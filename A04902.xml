            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

For the well accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of that which firſt I did ſpeake before your honour, put me in aſſured hope to finde an indifferent eare for this, whiche with more deliberation I ſhould commit to writing and the manifolde benefites which I haue receiued, conſtreined me to lay holde of any opportunitie offered, whereby I might le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>e ſome remembraunce of my thankefulneſſe and dutie toward a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of that honourable houſe of Warwick, to the which I am (in the Lord) ſo many wayes indebted. Wherof I haue in few wordes to ſay thus much, that I thinke there is great occaſion offered of thankefulneſſe vnto the Lord, who would that ſo many benefites and ſo much comforte ſhould come to me from thence, that he hath offered me alſo this opportunitie, to leaue behinde me a thankefull memorie thereof, that there might be ſome remembraunce continued of that thing, that hath in it greate deſeruing why it ſhuld not be ſoone forgotten. And to the Chriſtian reader whoſoeuer I ſay, that I am not ignorant into what danger I haue offered my ſelfe, attempting to write of that matter wherein ſo many and godly men with ſo greate fruite and commendation haue trauayled before me for to add any thing vnto them, or to differ any whit from them, will bee charged of ſome with noueltie, or ſecret reprehenſion of their trauayles, and to tread in the ſame ſteps with others that haue
<pb facs="tcp:7047:3"/>
gone before, ſhal not be able to auoide the blame of needleſſe la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and trauel to no purpoſe. I am therefore to require of all men that iudgement may not proceede againſt me, before I ſhal be admitted to ſpeake for my ſelfe, and that with indifferencie it may be heard what can be ſaid, why no ſuche ſentence ought by any right to paſſe againſt me or any other in the like atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt. And for the former charge (of adding any thing to the labours of ſo godly men) if thoſe who haue gone before vs hauing ſo litle helpe from their predeceſſours, haue notwithſtanding left great light vnto vs, ſo that being be truſted, but (as it were) with one talent, by their diligent trauel and occupying they haue made it fiue, I do not ſee, but that it may wel ſtand with the modeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of a Chriſtian of our time, being ſo richly left, and entering vpon ſo great a ſtocke, to trauel at the reckoning to be found at the leſt to haue gayned ſomething: nay, I do not ſee how we ſhal auoide the iuſt reproche of vnfaithful ſtewardes, if ſo many ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents increaſe nothing vnder our handes: ſo farre am I from imagining that the blame of noueltie or any ſuche thing, hathe in it iuſt cauſe to ſtay our trauell, or hinder our labour in that behalfe.</p>
            <p>And for the other charge (of treading in the ſame ſteppes with them that haue gone before vs) if that courſe ſhould be taken, there is much that might be ſaide for it. For the ſame meate which beeing prepared by one, doth pleaſe the taſte and ſtomach: beeing dreſſed by another, we haue no ſuche ſauour in it: and ſurely the affections of men ſtande no leſſe diuerſly affected towardes the varietie of Gods giftes in deliuering one and the ſame matter, then doth the ſtomache toward the diuerſitie of dreſſing of one and the ſame kinde of meate, ſo that in ſo great diuerſitie a man may with modeſtie hope to be directed vnto ſome, who ſhall finde themſelues hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen by his handeling of the matter, albeit no other thing be brought beſide that which hath beene heard of before: For as
<pb facs="tcp:7047:3"/>
the Lord will alway haue this aduantage againſte the wicked for the cleareing of his iuſtice, that it may truely be ſaid vnto them, in respect of the varietie of Gods giftes graunted them: <hi>We haue piped vnto you, but ye haue not daunſed:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 7.31.</note> 
               <hi>we haue mourned vnto you, and ye haue not wept:</hi> ſo wil he magnifie his mercie towardes thoſe that be his, in graunting them ſuche varietie of giftes, as no man ſhalbe ſo affected, but that he ſhall finde a helpe prepared, whereby he may be benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. We ſee then, that either of theſe courſes hathe not onely ſufficient defence to cleare it, but alſo muche to be ſaide in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendation of the ſame. The Christian Reader ſhal perceiue in peruſing this treatiſe of the lawe, that my trauel hath beene to let him ſee, that Chriſt is a Sauiour in deede vnto him, that he might perceiue the length, bredth, and depth of his mercies, and ſo be brought to imbrace them accordingly. And becauſe the greatneſſe of our corruption diſcouereth the riches of his grace, which is by ſo much the richer, as the pouertie is greater which it doth relieue: I haue laboured therefore to lay out our pouertie &amp; want in euerie particular commandement, &amp; how our affection ſtandeth naturally not indifferent, but an vtter enimie to the obedience required in the ſame: that in the ſight of ſo muche rebellion and ſinne, bleeding (as it were) in euerie part of vs of ſome deadly wound, we might ſlacke no time in ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vnto Chriſt Ieſus the only Phyſician of our ſoule: and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the number and daunger of thoſe wounds that he doth cure and couer in vs, we might neuer forget or ſmally account of, but alwayes worthily magnifie the greatneſſe of his grace and mercie towards vs.</p>
            <p>Which manner of proceeding (if it be indifferently exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned) ſhall be found to haue great fruite and profite in it: For to make vs carefull in ſeeking after Phyſick, this is not ſufficient, that we knowe our ſelues to be diſeaſed and ſick, but to know a number of diſeaſes to be growing vppon vs, &amp; thoſe of that
<pb facs="tcp:7047:4"/>
quantitie that euery of them threatneth preſent death, haue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing infected the principall partes of our life: that is it which maketh a man with all ſpeede to take him to the remedie ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the ſame. Many there are, who will not denye themſelues to be ſinners and ſicke of ſinne: but becauſe they neither knowe how many partes are infected, nor yet howe daungerous their infection is, their care to be releeued is the ſmaller, and their labour the leſſe to bee ridd of it. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vppon alſo it followeth, that he is ſo much the leſſe regarded who is to worke that cure vppon them: ſo that we ſee this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall lapping vp of ſinne, when it is not vnfolden to our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences and layd out in the ſeuerall braunches thereof, is not only hurtful vnto vs, but alſo iniurious vnto the due eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the death of Chriſte. I cannot more fitlie compare thoſe men (who will moſt willingly confeſſe them ſelues in generall words to be ſinners, and yet are very loath to be troubled with any particular knowledge thereof) then vnto ſome notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous offenders againſt the lawes and peace of their prince, who can willingly heare theſe generall wordes, that they bee offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and haue not kept the ſeuerall ſtatutes and lawes of their prince, ſo that they will proceede no further with them: but to be brought foorth and charged with their ſeuerall fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies, murthers, or treaſons that they haue committed, and to haue their wickedneſſe particularly layd out in number of dedes, &amp; manner of doing, that may beſt ſet out the heynouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe thereof, that, in no eaſe, may be abidden: and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding before that time, neither is their owne eſtate greatly feared, nor yet the lawe ſo much as thought vppon how to bee ſatisfied. It is this particular ſight of ſinne that ſendeth vs forthwith vnto Chriſt, and maketh him appeare both glorious in the multitude of his ſo greate mercies, and moſte neceſſarie in the conſideration of our ſo many daungerous infirmities.</p>
            <p>If it pleaſe the Reader in the examining of him ſelfe in any commaundement, foorthwith to ioyne to the ſame that which is written here of the properties of loue, and that other nexte
<pb facs="tcp:7047:4"/>
Lecture of the vſe of the lawe: he ſhall finde (I hope) ſome helpe in them, the ſooner to departe from him ſelfe, and the more carefully to imbrace Christe. And that he may be acquainted the better with my meaning, and purpoſe in this matter, I will giue him in fewe wordes the reaſon of the ſame.</p>
            <p>I ſee in the lawe of God that we are not only forbidden the workes of our owne deuotion and intent, &amp; bound to that choiſe of workes that God hath appointed in his word: but alſo that we are ſtrictly charged to doe the ſame, all and euerie one of them in loue, which is an affection that carrieth a man ſo in delight after the thinges which he loueth, that he oftentimes forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth himſelfe in respect thereof, according as it is reported by the holy Ghoſt (as a propertie to know it by) that loue ſeketh not her owne thinges. This is the cauſe why after the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes I haue ſet downe the notes and properties to diſcerne loue by, that when we haue ſeene what workes they be that we are bound to doe, we may alſo ſee with what affection we are charged to do the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: that we may be as careful to bring the right manner of doing vnto the Lord, as the verie deede that he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proueth. For we are as well to perfourme duetie in the manner of doing, as in the deed it ſelfe: It is one and the ſame God who hath inioyned both vnto vs, and therefore may not be denyed in either of them. The vſe of the lawe which is in the Lecture following, wil declare with what conditions we haue wages pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed for our worke, and whether the couenant be ſo fauoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as that we neede not to doubt, but that we ſhall be able to perfourme it, and therefore to liue in it: or otherwiſe ſo harde, (as the trueth is in verie deede) that he remayneth vnder the curſe of God, who continueth not in all thinges that are written in the booke of the lawe to do them. Let vs then ſet theſe together. Firſt, the number of deeds: then, the manner of doing, whiche muſt haue in it thoſe properties that be in loue: and last of al, the hard condition, which is, not to haue our good doeings to blotte out and put off our euil, but to remaine vnder the curſe, if we ſhall not continue in euerie thing that is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb facs="tcp:7047:5"/>
in the booke of the lawe to doe it: and then we ſhalbe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to giue ouer this ſtrong holde, euen this confidence in our ſelues, and betake vs wholy to the mercie of our God, and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the ſame accordingly. And leaſt we ſhould imagine the matter of letting go the opinion of our ſelues and our worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to be nothing ſo hard as is ſuppoſed, and therefore no ſuch nede to haue ſo often before vs in meditation and earneſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration thereof the multitude of deedes to be doone, the louing manner of doing, and the hard condition if they ſhall not be doone: Let vs aduiſedly conſider, how that ſingular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of God S. Paule confeſſeth, that he himſelfe was ſo ſubiect vnto this ouer great opinion of him ſelf, that the meſſenger of ſathan was ſent vnto him to buffet him,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 12.7</note> leaſte hee ſhould be puffed vp with the meaſure of graces, whiche were giuen vnto him. The daunger is greater therefore then we are aware of, when ſo rare an inſtrument and choſen ſeruaunt of GOD as was Paule, ſo hardely and with ſo much a doe, is brought to haue an humble opinion of him ſelfe and his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe.</p>
            <p>The Romiſh religion likewiſe (fighting ſo ſtoutely for the deſerte of man) may teach vs, that this doctrine of true hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling and ſubmitting of our ſelues vnto our God, wil not ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilie enter into fleaſh and bloud, as at the firſt we would ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine: but that we haue neede often to ſet before vs this looke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing glaſſe of the lawe, in manner as hath beene declared, to humble vs withall: and all ſhall bee founde little inoughe to bring vs truely from our ſelues, and to ſende vs, not in parte, but wholy, vnto the mercies of our GOD, whiche are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared vnto vs at large in the next Lecture after the vſe of the lawe.</p>
            <p>When we ſhall haue profited in drawing nere vnto Chriſt, and making much of his mercie, by an often and true ſight of our ſelues in the lawe, there is yet remayning an other vſe and fruite to be taken by it, of no leſſe profite then the former: whiche is, that when wee ſhall haue taken comforte in
<pb facs="tcp:7047:5"/>
the mercies of Chriſt, and decreed to walke in the obedience of his will, to declare our thankefulneſſe thereby: the lawe will ſtand vs in good ſtead to quicken vs therevnto, while wee learne by it, bothe the number of things that are to be done, and alſo the backwardneſſe of our naturall diſpoſition and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination therevnto: which we could not once (without this admonition from the lawe) haue ſuſpected to haue beene ſo greate, and therefore our care to ſuppreſſe it, would haue bene ſo much the leſſe. But hauing determined once to walke in the wayes of his commaundements, and then hauing warning from the lawe, that there is bothe in our witt and will enimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie therevnto, altogether bent to reſiſt it: it can not but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe our care, and add vnto our paines and trauaile, for the atteining vnto that end of obedience which we haue propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vnto vs. For the man who hath a deſire vnto any thinge, vnderſtanding once of any let in the way, is thereby more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked and ſtirred vp to beſtowe cares and paines vppon the ſame: knowing very well, that the thing which he deſireth can not otherwiſe be compaſſed.</p>
            <p>And where is that man then, that ſeeing what duties are to be perfourmed bothe to the Lord, and to his brethren, and in what manner of affection and loue, (for it is the end of Chriſte his death, and the purchaſe of his paſſion to haue a number not only giuen, but zelouſly giuen vnto good workes) remembring withall, what an enimie he hath at home of his owne nature, if there be any feare of God in him, that ſhall not be occaſioned hereby more plentifully to practiſe the meanes of his ſaluation: eſpecially knowing, that thoſe who are ingraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the body of Chriſte, muſt dye vnto ſinne and riſe vp in to theſe fruites of righteouſnes? Moreouer the knowledge and meditation of the lawe and commaundements, doe helpe vs forward vnto true and ſincere Chriſtianitie. For a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber deceiue them ſelues in a generall good meaning whiche they haue to ſerue the Lord, taking that to be the true ſeruice of him: and in the meane time are nothing carefull to keepe a
<pb facs="tcp:7047:6"/>
good conſcience in the ſeuerall dueties of the lawe, nor any thing traueyling to traine vp their affections to delight ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: as if in Chriſtianitie we were to roue vncerteinely aboute good motions and good meanings, and had no certeine marks of ſeuerall dueties ſet before vs to ſhoote at, that we might ſo iudge of our ſelues, as we ſee vs come ſhorte or wide of them: whereas the true Chriſtian, in very deede profiteth in drawing neerer and neerer vnto the Lord, in making his life and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation more conformable vnto the ſeuerall duties ſet downe in the commaundementes, beeing likewiſe carefull to approue his doings by the lawes &amp; ſtatutes made for the ſame, as in ciuil dealings and traffique, a man wil feare to offende againſt the lawes and ſtatutes prouided in that behalfe. And as a wiſe man that hath much dealing in the worlde, wil haue ſome abstract of the ſtatutes, that (as occaſion requireth) he may turne to them, and ſo deale without danger of lawe: ſo it ſtandeth well with the policie of a Chriſtian, to be ſkilfull in the ſtatutes of his God, that when he hath to deale with the name of his brother, lookeing in this abſtract, he may ſee the cautions to be obſerued in the ſame, that he offend not againſt the lawes and ſtatutes of the Higheſt: &amp; when ſoeuer he hath to deale with his goodes, he may turne in like maner to that ſtatute that hath prouided for wel dealing therin, &amp; ſo auoide the dangers that otherwiſe he ſhould fall into. The like is to be done, when there are dealings immediately betwene vs &amp; the Lord, that we ſhould often loke into this briefe abſtract of the ſtatutes of our God, to ſee alwayes what is the prouiſo that is made for his glorie, and the ſuppreſſing of our owne corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Our corrupte nature doeth aſke all this of vs, and the man that feareth God giueth no leſſe vnto it. For the bleſſed man is ſaide to meditate in the lawe of his God day and night. Nay, we ſee that the only wiſe God (who knoweth better then we our ſelues what nede we haue) hath appointed vs yet more meanes, and therfore we muſt thinke that there is more vnto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnes in vs, then we could of our ſelues ſuspect. For he hath
<pb facs="tcp:7047:6"/>
left it a perpetuall order for the education of his children, that there ſhould be men of ſpecial giftes, both for learning and apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to teach, &amp; alſo for good life: who by teaching, exhorting, and reprouing, ſhould (as it were) whet the word to make it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. It muſt of neceſſitie bee an hard matter, that requireth ſuch inſtruments, &amp; ſuch workemen, for both the inſtrument and the workmen are from aboue: The wiſedome of the world could not perfourme this, and therefore the Gospell (which is the arme and power of God vnto ſaluation) was ſent from the boſome of the father: and for the workemen, we are not at our choyſe to take where it ſeemeth good vnto vs, but they are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to our ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d by the holy Ghoſt, who hath ſet downe ſuch notes of good learning &amp; good life to diſcerne them by, who are of his ſending, and fit for ſo weightie a worke, as that they giue forth a plaine teſtimonie vnto vs, that they come from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, framed and prepared of the Lord him ſelf vnto this work.</p>
            <p>As the goodneſſe of our God could not deny vs any thing neceſſarie, ſo his wiſedome would not that we ſhould be loaden with any thing ſuperfluous and vnneceſſarie, which muſt force vs to conclude againſt our ſelues, that we are not knowen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our ſelues, vnleſſe we ſee matter within vs, neceſſarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring to be pricked forward with the liuely preaching and ſounding miniſterie of the word: and that we tempt the Lord, if we content our ſelues with our priuate readings and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and despiſe the preaching of the worde: which the Lord hath ſeene to be ſo neceſſarie, that hee hath appointed it not for one ſorte of men, but vnto all, of what condition ſoeuer: neither vnto age alone, but perpetuall for all ages and times. The labours therefore of them that doe write, are not taken in hand, that men ſtanding vpon them, ſhould contemne or leſſe frequent the publique miniſterie of the Church: but to bring them into greater loue and liking with the ſame, that recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſome fruite that way, they might looke for a greate deale more by that which is appoynted by the Lorde,<note place="margin">Col. 1.21</note> to preſent vs perfect in Chriſte Ieſus.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:7047:7"/>Concerning theſe Lectures, I am to craue generally of all men to whoſe handes they ſhall come, that in what point ſo euer they ſhall thinke their admonition may doe mee good, they woulde not denie mee that Chriſtian and Brotherly helpe: and likewiſe if they ſhall in any thing finde them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues holpen by my trauell, that as they are to returne the whole praiſe vnto GOD (to whome onely it is due) ſo they woulde not denie the comfort of their prayers vnto him, whom the Lord in mercie hath vouchſafed to make an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (though moſt vnworthie) of ſome goodneſſe vnto them. And of your honour (my verie good Ladie) I am moſt humblie to require, that this dutie (how ſlenderly ſoeuer performed) may according to your accuſtomed clemencie be well accepted of: that what want ſoeuer be in the work, either of that you deſire, or that I were in duetie to perfourme, may finde a ſupplie here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, for that it proceedeth from a minde moſte willing to anſwer your deſire, and moſte vnwilling (if abilitie did ſerue) to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde with the leaſte parte of that, that duetie may in any reſpect demaunde.</p>
            <p>And as al good Chriſtians ſhould rather be deſirous to lerne howe to go forwarde, then to heare what good beginnings they haue made, ſo I doubt not (Madame) but a fewe wordes vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered to that ende (eſpecially from me that haue great cauſe to be thankeful vnto God, for that he hath already wrought in you) ſhall finde better interteinement with your honour, then much ſpeeche directed to an other purpoſe, howe good and iuſt ſoeuer the cauſe be that might prouoke me thervnto. It was a ſaying ſometime of Aſia, that it was no prayſe neuer to haue ſeene it, but to haue liued temperately in Aſia, was praiſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie: ſo many were the allurements, &amp; ſo great was the intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perancie thereof. I thinke we may nowe (altering the words) reteine the trueth of the matter, if we ſhould ſay: it were no great matter, neuer to haue ſeene the Courtes of Princes, but to haue liued Chriſtianly in thoſe Courtes, were a ſpecial work of Chriſt in his. And therefore (Madame) as ſometimes I

ſpake in the hearing of your honour, ſo nowe I ſay againe, that where the aſſault of the aduerſarie lyeth ſoreſt againſt any, there wiſedome would, that the inſtruments to beare off and to beate backe the ſame, ſhould be more in number, and ſtronger in effect. And for this cauſe we do reade, that in the Courte of Iſrael the Prince himſelfe, who for the number and weight of affaires was (as may be thought) by ſome iuſt title to be pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uileged aboue the reſt, might not be exempted from keeping this diligent watch and warde in his owne perſon, (by reading all the dayes of his life in the lawes of his God) againſt the dangers that by reaſon of that place he was in great danger of: diuers wherof, after they are recited in Deuteronomie, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately the holy Ghoſt giueth the medicine for them, whiche is, to be occupied in the lawes of his God, all the dayes of his life. If any by daily meditation in the lawe of God,<note place="margin">Pro. 4.8.</note> ſhall thus exalt wiſdome (that is the word of God) by making it the chief delighte of their heart, beſide the auoyding of theſe daungers and ſuche like, there is a promiſe paſſed from the Lord, that wiſedome ſhall exalt them. If they ſhall ſett her in place and eſtimation aboue all other things, ſhe will requite it againe, by aduauncing their honour and eſtate aboue the condition of others: but if they ſhall make no more of her, but as a common thing, ſhe wil anſwer them in like meaſure againe, to leaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in place &amp; eſtimation with the common &amp; worſt ſort of men.</p>
            <p>The honour therfore of aduauncement (which all men are giuen to haue ſo great lyking of) commeth neither from the Eaſt nor fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Weſt, but from the Lord him ſelf: &amp; this true honour wayteth vpon all of them, whom imploy them ſelues, their countenance and their credite, to honour and aduaunce this wiſedome, which is the worde of God.

            <p>At the publiſhing of this lawe of God, there was great terrour &amp; feare on euery ſide. For (as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in this former chapter) the mount Synai was all on ſmoke, and the Lorde came downe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it in fier, and the ſmoke thereof aſcended as the ſmoke of a fornace, and all the mount trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled excedingly.

that he would ſpeake vnto them, and that they might not heare the Lorde leaſt they died, ſo great was their feare, and ſo woonderfully were they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſed at the matter. It was very requiſite and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie, that this maieſtie of the lord ſhould come in with the entrance of his worde. For we are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to make ſmall reckoning of it, &amp; lightly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect the authoritie thereof. For, doe not thouſands imagine that they ſufficiently reuerence the maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie of the Lord, when notwithſtanding, they liue without all awe, feare, and reuerence of his word? Nedeful therefore was it, nay moſt neceſſary, that the maieſtie of the Lord ſhould viſibly come forth after a glorious maner at the deliuery of the word: that men might vnderſtand that the neglect of the worde, is the contempt of the maieſtie and honor of the Lorde. For the Lorde hath coupled his honor, and glorie to his word, ſo that they can not neglect the one, but that they muſt in ſo doing co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

God bringing teſtimony and authoritie thervnto, both with ſignes and woonders, and diuers myra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and giftes of the holie Ghoſt. Well did the Lorde vnderſtand, that words are but winde with men, and therefore it was the good pleaſure of his will, that neither his law, nor Goſpel ſhould come naked and bare into the world, but with the credit of his owne glorie, and countenaunce of his owne maieſtie. For, the goſpell as now we haue heard, was not only preached by the Lorde Ieſus, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo confirmed by the miniſterie of thoſe that heard him, with ſignes, woonders, and myracles: ſo that to neglect the gouerneme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the word, is, to tread vnder feete the maieſtie of the Lorde. Hauing made this entrance I doe proceede vnto the texte, where I am enforced to ſpeake a little of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the wordes, becauſe they bring great light to the true vnderſtanding, and meaning of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>The word IEHOVAH which is here engliſhed Lorde, is a name of God, giuing vnto him his true nature and eſſence, which is, ſo to haue his begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and being, of him ſelfe, as in him, &amp; by him, all thinges that are, haue their beeing: and therfore it is vſually ſet before the promiſes and couenants of the Lorde in the ſcripture, that we ſhoulde not doubt of the perfourmance thereof, ſeeing it is the couenant &amp; promiſe of that God that hath his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning and beeing of him ſelf, and procureth the beeing and perfourmance of all things vnto them: in ſo much that the Lorde denieth in Exodus that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:7047:11"/>
he was knowne to Abraham, Iſaac, and Iacob, by his name Iehouah,<note place="margin">Exo. 3.9.</note> bicauſe he had not perfourmed in their time the promiſes made for their deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance out of Egypt, and for their poſſeſsion of the lande of Canaan. The verbe is not vſually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed of the Hebrues in the like phraſes, where the ſenſe is apparant, and therefore of ſome is ſette downe before the word, <hi>Lorde,</hi> and read thus. <hi>I am the Lorde thy GOD:</hi> of other ſome nexte after the word, <hi>Lorde,</hi> and then it is read thus: <hi>I the Lorde am thy GOD,</hi> wherin, although in ſenſe there be no difference, but that both affirme one and the ſelfe ſame thinge, yet bicauſe there is more cleare vnderſtanding of that one and the ſame thinge, by placing the verbe next after the worde, <hi>Lorde,</hi> I ſee no cauſe why the practiſe of ſome ſhould be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudiciall in this matter, but that it may be ſaid. <hi>I the Lorde am thy GOD.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In affirming that he is their God, he aſſureth them of all mercy and happineſſe, from him ſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, both in this life and in the life to come, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a league with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to make himſelfe knowne to be their God, by the mercies he had to beſtowe vpon them, and that he would haue the care and charge of their welfare, reſerued to himſelfe alone. It remaineth to be proued by the ſcripture, that this manner of ſpeaking (to be their God) contey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth promiſſes in it, for this life and for the life to come. In the pſalme,<note place="margin">Pſal. 144.15</note> the Prophete hauing made mention of ſundry outward bleſsings in children, in increaſe of corne and cattel, peace and freedome

are made the fruites that followe of hauing him to be their God, whiche is all done freely, and vndeſeruedly, as the Lorde plainely profeſſeth in the ſame chapiter in theſe wordes:<note place="margin">Verſ. 32.</note> 
               <hi>Bee it knowen vnto you, that I doe not theſe thinges for your ſake</hi> (ſayth the Lorde) <hi>therefore O ye houſe of Iſrael, he aſhamed and confounded for your owne wayes.</hi> Neither doeth this mercy of hauing the Lorde to bee our God, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne it ſelfe within the compaſſe of this life, but reacheth vnto the bleſſinges of the life to come, as appeareth in the Goſpell after Saincte Luke,<note place="margin">Luke. 20.37.38.</note> where our Sauiour Chriſte proueth that it muſt needes be well with Abraham, and that hee muſte riſe againe, bycauſe it is written, <hi>The Lorde is the God of Abraham, for he is not the GOD of the dead,</hi> (ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth our Sauiour Chriſte) <hi>but of them that liue.</hi>

            <p>In the Epiſtle to the Hebrues, Abraham,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.10.</note> and others the children of God, are reported to haue bene ſtraungers in the land of promiſe, and not to haue ſene the promiſes fulfilled in their time: whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che might ſeeme to make againſte this that I haue ſayd, concerning the bleſſing of them to whom the Lord is become God: but it is anſwered there, that he was not aſhamed to bee called their God, for he had prepared for them a citie: as if that whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che ſeemed to be wanting in this life, were ſo ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently recompe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced in that ioye that did abide for them, as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Lord neded not to be aſhamed to be called their God, ſo rich was his mercie towardes them.

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:7047:13"/>
(as it is well noted by M.<note place="margin">Peter mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr vppon Rom. 7.</note> Peeter Martyr) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to this damnable opinion of certeine, who holde, that the fathers of the olde Teſtament, had no promiſes, ſauing of the lande of Canaan, and temporall thinges. We ſee that the Lorde made promiſe to be their God, which (as we haue heard) hath promiſes bothe of this life, and of the life to come. And (as it appeareth in Geneſis) all the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies that Abraham receiued,<note place="margin">Gene. 17.7.</note> were conteined vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſe wordes (which are the wordes of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenaunt) <hi>I will be God to thee and to thy ſeede after thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The benifite (that here is ſet downe) of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of the land of Egypt, &amp; from the houſe of bondage, is an experience whiche they had of this goodneſſe of God, wherin he did apparauntly declare him ſelfe to be their God, and ſo likewiſe it is in other places brought in as a confirmation of the couenaunt:<note place="margin">Deut. 7.8.9.</note> 
               <hi>Becauſe the Lorde loued you</hi> (ſayth the holy ghoſt) <hi>and becauſe he would keep the othe which he had ſworn to your fathers, the Lord hath brought you out by a mightie hand, and deliuered you out of the houſe of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, from the hand of Pharao king of Egypt, that thou may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt knowe, that the Lorde thy God hee is GOD, the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full God, whiche keepeth couenaunt and mercie vnto them that loue him, and keepe his commaundements.</hi> This expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of God his goodneſſe towardes them, and the triall that hee is become their GOD, maketh much to bring an obedience, and therefore is pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with the couenaunt. For when we haue tryall in deed, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord hath ſpeciall good wil towards vs, it hath greate force in it, to bring vs willingly
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:7047:13"/>
vnder his obedience. Therefore we are taught by this, alwayes to haue in memorie thoſe benefits of God, that haue in them the note and marke of ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall good will and lyking, ſuch as he beareth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Children. For the remembraunce of thoſe, will draw dueties from vs, that ſhall proceed from a frank and free hart. Let vs therefore haue a regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of his greateſt benefites done vnto vs: Let vs call to minde what a ſpeciall benefite this is, if we had none other, that when we were (as is the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of all Adams children) following the luſts and affections of our owne hart, in that brode way that leadeth vnto death, which ſo many followe, it hath pleaſed him to pick vs out of ſo many, to giue vs myſliking of that courſe of life, whiche by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture we are ſo addict and inclyned vnto, &amp; the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt hungring and thirſting after that righteouſnes that is approued by his worde: His benefites may not be ouer paſſed without conſideration, they ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with them ſtrong perſuaſion vnto obedience, the faithful doe vſe this helpe to further obedience vnto God. In the laſt chapter of Ioſua,<note place="margin">Ioſua. 24.</note> there is mention made of the ſeuerall benefites of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed vpon his people, and all for this end, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clayme them from ſinne, and to ſtirre them to free and willing ſeruice of the Lord. And the people (in the ſame Chapter) alledge his benefites recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, as a reaſon, why they neither may nor wil re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe obedience vnto him. <hi>God forbid</hi> (ſay the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) <hi>that we ſhould forſake the Lord to ſerue other Goddes. For the Lorde brought vs and our fathers out of the land of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:7047:14"/>
Aegypt, from the houſe of bondage, and he did thoſe greate myracles in our ſight, and preſerued vs in all the way that we went, and among all the people, through whome we came, and the Lord did caſt out all the people, euen the Amorites which dwelt in the land, therfore will we ſerue the Lord, for hee is our GOD.</hi> They gather by theſe benefites that he is their God, and conclude therfore that they wil ſerue the Lord becauſe he is their God, and hath beene ſo ſingulerly good &amp; beneficiall vnto them.</p>
            <p>And in very deede this perſuaſion that hee is our God, and ſo tenderly affected towardes vs, is the mother of all true obedience, the founteine from whence floweth all true worſhip and ſeruice of God, the note that diſcerneth betweene the workes of a true Chriſtian, and the deedes of an Infidel or heathen man. The Chriſtian worketh his obedience, hauing this perſuaſion, that God is already his GOD: The Infidel and vnbeleeuer hath no ſuche perſuaſion, and therefore his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inges come not franckly and freely from him to honour the Lorde, but ſlauiſhly and ſeruilely to ſerue himſelfe, and after that manner, as it were, to get within the Lorde, and to earne his ſaluation of him ſelfe, It is this faith which made the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene the ſacryfice of Abell, and the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of Cayne, as the Scripture doeth declare. It is this faith, that maketh the difference betwene the continencie that we haue reade to haue beene in Infidelles and Paganes, and that whiche is in Chriſtians: betweene the mercie and almes that procedeth oftentimes from ciuil men, and that
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:7047:14"/>
merciful reliefe that commeth from Chriſtians: It is this perſuaſion of his goodneſſe that iuſtifieth the one, whereas y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other wanting this is odious &amp; hateful in his ſight. It is this perſuaſion, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> God is ſo rich in goodneſſe as to accept of vs, which ſendeth vs to the true ſeruice of him. The Lord is not only contented to ſay, that he is their GOD, but alſo to bring good euidence for the ſame, in putting the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in mind of that ſingular benefite of their deliuerance from Egypt, which he had beſtowed vpon them.</p>
            <p>Wee learne then in this Commaundemente (which chargeth vs that we take the Lorde for our God) that he hath taken vpon him ſelfe the proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to ſtoare vs with graces and bleſſings, bothe for this life, and for the life to come: and will haue the honour and glorie of it him ſelf alone, becauſe he will declare the riches of his graces towards his faithfull people, and by his dealing with them, bee knowen to be their God. Therefore, he bindeth vs to ſeeke for all good things at his hands alone: and in like manner, when we haue receiued any thing by humble thankſgiuing to returne y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole praiſe therof vnto him again. Now that we know y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ning of this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, it behoueth vs to apply it to our profit: wherein we muſt firſt vnderſtand, that by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meanes of ſin (which is in euery man by nature) man his wit &amp; vnderſtanding hath receiued ſuch a blindneſſe, as it cannot conceiue the trueth of this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement, &amp; alſo his wil &amp; affection is ſo poyſoned, as it cannot take any ioy or lyking in it: the tryall wherof, may be had in this manner:
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:7047:15"/>
when the man that is not borne againe and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued into mercie (whome the ſcripture calleth the naturall man becauſe all are ſuch by nature) whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he (I ſay) is in any ſtreight or neceſſitie, either becauſe he wanteth neceſſary foode for this life, or for that he is in da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger to looſe welth, credit, or life, &amp; ſeeth not the ordinarie meanes, by which it is likely hee ſhould eſcape y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> danger: Let it the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be tolde him, that God is his God, &amp; hath a loue towards him, and a care ouer him, &amp; wil in his time by lawful meanes prouide for him: yet notwithſtanding his wit nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceueth this perſuation, nor his wil &amp; affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is any thing made ioyful or comforted therby, as one that deſirouſly enclyneth after the hope thereof: which is declared by this, that ſome fall to ſtealinge, or ſeeking vnto witches, wiſemen, or wiſewomen (as they call them) to haue their gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>efes remedied, and their wantes ſupplied: others not vſing the ſame, yet by one vnlawfull meanes or other, winde them ſelues out of daunger, not wayting by faith vpon the Lord, vntill by lawfull meanes he procure their deliuerance.</p>
            <p>This corruption alſo of the naturall man, is no leſſe euident, when he is out of danger and hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary meanes to maintaine him by. For when a naturall man hath credit, wealthe, or freendes to compaſſe matters by, either not at all doth he ſeek to God by prayer to proſper thoſe meanes whiche he vſeth: either elſe if hee pray vnto him, it is ſo coldely, as that euery man may perceiue, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially his owne conſcience may tell him, that his
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:7047:15"/>
hope ariſeth, rather from the meanes he hath, then from the goodnes of God, without whoſe bleſſing all helps are nothing: &amp; yet for all that, he findeth no fault with him ſelfe for want of faith, but will proteſt, that he taketh God to be his God, and loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth for all things from him, beleeuing as aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in him, as the beſt of them all. It is not greatly to bee merueyled at, if the naturall man giue ſo much vnto the meanes, for it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth often times to paſſe, that the Lorde is conſtrayned in dealinge with his Children, to withdrawe ſomething from the number or ſtength, euen of his lawfull and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary meanes, that the glorie may be wholy his. A notable example wherof we haue in the booke of the Iudges,<note place="margin">Iudg. 7.1.</note> where the Lorde cauſed Gedeon to ſend away the greateſt parte of his men when hee ſhuld go to battail, giuing the reaſon of his doing in theſe words. <hi>The people that are with thee, are to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny for me to giue the Madianites into their handes, leſt Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael make their vaunt againſt me, and ſay, My handes haue ſaued me.</hi> Thus corrupte is the eſtate that all men are borne in, and in this eſtate doe all men conty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, finding no faulte, nor miſlyking of the ſame, ſaue that little flock of Chriſtes, that by the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite of his death are exempted from it, whome when it pleaſeth God to call vnto the hope of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting life, by the meanes of his word, he clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth their wit and vnderſtanding to conceiue the goodnes of this God to them warde, hee purgeth their wil and affection to take comforte in it: And therefore when meanes want, they are not (as the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:7047:16"/>
wicked) altogether without hope, running after vnlawfull meanes, but waite better vppon their God: and when they haue the ordinarie meanes whereby God vſually bringeth matters to paſſe, they are careful in crauing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſucceſſe of it, yea with inwarde perſuaſion of heart, to finde no fruite but by his bleſſing.</p>
            <p>The man that will truely examine himſelfe in this commaundement, muſte well conſider with himſelfe, what euil and vnlawfull ſhiftes he hath made throughout this life, in his diſtreſſe and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie, or what doubtes and feares of not beeing well, and in due time prouided for, haue ariſen at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch in time his hart, &amp; how tickle his nature is thervnto. Likewiſe when hee hath had the vſuall meanes of Gods mercies, he muſte conſider well, how ſparing and how colde he hath been in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to God for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſucceſſe of them, which declareth, that his truſt was rather in them, then in God the giuer of them. Thus may he eaſily perceiue in what a miſerable condition he ſhould haue beene, had not the mediatour and redeemer Chriſt Ieſus aunſwered the matter for him. It is therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, that after this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner he throughly examine his infirmitie and diſobedience, vntill he be truely humbled and brought to Chriſte, to ſee the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite of his death and paſſion, how greate it is, and how needful for him, when by due examining of himſelfe he doeth well vnderſtand, that he is who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beholden vnto God for the benefite of his ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe by the lawe they are accurſſed that
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:7047:16"/>
continue not in all things which are written in the booke of the law to doe them:<note place="margin">2. Cor. 5.</note> then is he forced to acknowledge that it is good right and reaſon that his life ſhould be ordered after the pleaſure and wil of him, that by his death hath brought deliuerance vnto him from euerlaſting death and deſtruction, and the hope alſo of a bleſſed eſtate to continue for euer. Whervpon, he proceedeth not only to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſliking of this corrupt nature of his, but alſo to the ſuppreſſing of it, that it deale not as it was accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, neither when it wanteth meanes, nor yet whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it enioyeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, calling earneſtly vnto God by prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er that he may ſo increaſe in faith, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he may glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie him in the obedience of this commaundement. His profiting in this obedience (how great ſoeuer) is alwayes ioyned with true humilitie, becauſe hee wel vnderſtandeth (by the ſight that he hath of him ſelf) y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſtandeth by the mercies of God in Chriſt alone, becauſe alſo he plainly perceiueth that his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience is not without frailtie and manifolde in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities cleauing vnto it: as his obedience is not with out humility, ſo his falles &amp; infirmities ar not without grief &amp; vexatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of hart, whilſt he ſeeth in them the diſhonour and obedience of that God, of whoſe free goodnes he holdeth al y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he hath or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth for. A great number perſuade the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues that their faith is perfect inough, &amp; no want in it at all, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding in their neceſſities &amp; diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes they are all ready to doubt &amp; diſtruſt of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort, as if they had neuer heard of the Goſpell, nor lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned any thing of the promiſes made vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full:
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:7047:17"/>
Nay, which more is, they ſhall no ſooner be in any diſtreſſe, but they are as farre from hope in God, and as redy to helpe them ſelues by one euill ſhift or other, as thoſe ciuil men which haue no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in them at all: And all this notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ing, they cannot ſee, nor be brought to acknowledge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny want in their faith. Let a man bee broughte ſomething behinde hand (as we ſay) either by loſſe that he hath had in his ſheepe or cattle, or by mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of euill creditors with whome hee hath hadd dealinges, and by and by he wil be ready to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that he ſhall not be able to liue, vnleſſe he vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his commodyties at a greater price then before he hath done, when notwithſtanding, hee hath gone as farre before, as conſcyence coulde in any reſpect giue him leaue. Hee thinketh that his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer decay, doth priuiledge and make lawfull this kinde of dealing: and vnderſtand by the way, that in all this purpoſe &amp; practiſe, he receiueth not any ſuſpition, that there ſhould be any wante of faithe or weakeneſſe in that behalf, when as in very deed: then is there true tryall of our faith, if in our nece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſitie, wee ſhall thereby ſtay vs from euill meanes, in hope to haue vs prouided for according to his promiſe, albeit we ſee not any likelyhood therof, ſo far as our reaſon can reache. For in faith there is hope beyonde hope.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 4.</note>The Children of God by the eyes of faith, ſee a ſecret bleſſing promiſed, which they apprehend by hope, when as the common ſorte wanting this eye, caſt away all hope, vnleſſe by a ſenſible

manner they perceiue and preſently may groape the goodnes and help of God. The man that will take no knowledge that there is wante of faithe in him, but doth profeſſe (as the moſt wil do) that he truſteth in God with all his heart, and that there is no miſtruſt of God in any parte or corner thereof, is to be ſent back to his doeings and thoughts that are and haue beene in him in the time of his trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, dangers, pouertie or decay: to conſider if there haue beene the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in his hart, no more doubting, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring or ſuſpecting to bee prouided for, from the Lorde, then hath beene in other times: by this meanes (if there bee any ſenſe or iudgement in him) he ſhall be conſtrained to confeſſe the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his faith, &amp; ſo ſeeke his comfort in Chriſt, beeing conuict within him ſelfe, of ſuche miſtruſt and vnbeliefe, as the lawe doeth accurſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne. For if a man wil not willingly be wiſe in the beguyling of him ſelfe, he may ſoone ſee and perceiue a greate diuerſitie in him ſelfe at thoſe times: that where ſo longe as hee had helpes and and holdes to go by, he was comfortable, bolde &amp; confident, thoſe beeing taken away, hee is become without all courage, comforte or hope. If there were no want of faith, how could there bee any lack of comforte or hope? If his confidence were not in the meanes, how could he be as a man with out all hart or hope, ſo ſoone as the meanes are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vtterly taken away or elſe diminiſhed: eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſeeing the goodneſſe of the Lord, whiche is the ground of faith indureth for euer?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:7047:18"/>And that the man, whiche will take no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the want of his faith, may bee brought to the ſighte of himſelfe, let him well conſider with himſelfe, what ſhoulde bee the cauſe, that when he hath aboundance, and wanteth no neceſſarie help, he is ſo exceeding ſparing and careleſſe, in his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſeruing and ſeeking of the Lorde: in reſpect of the feare, and care that he is in, ſo ſoone as he ſhall be any way diſtreſſed, and the paynes alſo that then he taketh in his manner of ſeruing the Lorde, if his faith be at both times one, why ſhuld his care; whiche doth bewray his feare, be almoſte none at one time, and ſo plentifull at another: but onely that there was want of faith before, albeit he coulde not eſpie it, the meanes ſtanding as a myſt or a cloude betweene him, and the light that would teache him truly to diſcerne. The man therefore y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> boaſteth of the perfection of his faith, not feeling any want therin: denying that he truſteth in his riches, friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, authoritie, or wealth, muſte bee willed to ſette them a while aſide in his thoughts and conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, imagining ſeriouſly and in good earneſt, that he had them not: then let him aſke his conſcience, &amp; truly ſerch out his ſpirits, whither he could be as confident, comfortable, and hopefull in his heart, in the wanting, as in the hauing thereof, his heart will then tell him the contrarie, if he ſearch truely and throughly, and his deedes will declare no leſſe. For we ſhall ſe ſuch as couragious, and as confident as may be in their wealth, credit, and health: and when they are taken away, as faint and feeble, as men that
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:7047:18"/>
neither haue hart nor hope. Thus muſt a man be ſif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted both in abundance and want, that in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true ſight of his pouertie, he may be forced carefully &amp; thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to lay hould vpon the mercies brought by Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. As for vs that profeſſe we know Chriſt, &amp; are led to magnifie his mercies, by the experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of ſinne that we haue within our ſelues: Let vs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that it is our parte, to declare that we are his, and in him, by dying vnto ſinne, and liuing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to righteouſneſſe. Let vs therefore bee aſhamed to beare the name of Chriſt, &amp; to carrie y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tenance of them that loue his goſpell, and yet in our ncceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities to bee as miſtruſtfull, and as readie to helpe it by one vnlawfull ſhift or other, as euer we were: or as they are, that neither profeſſe nor knowe the goſpell. Let vs be aſhamed to profeſſe the goſpell, and in the meane time to be at no more miſlyking, nor warre with our miſtruſtfull thoughtes, then wee haue beene, when wee had no knowledge of the ſame. Hath not the Lord therefore died,<note place="margin">Rom. 6.</note> that by his power we might die vnto ſinne? hath he not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to weaken the power and ſtrength of ſinne in thoſe that be his, that although they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not driue ſinne from being at all in the fleſh, yet they might driue it from reigning and rulinge in them, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beating the power and force thereof? How can men thinke then, that there is any trueth of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianitie begunne in them, beeing in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner affected towarde their miſtruſtfull thoughtes and euil ſhiftes, that proceede thereof, as they were from the beginning ere euer they knewe the word
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:7047:19"/>
and Goſpel of their GOD: hauing no more ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of them, nor greater war and ſtrife with them? It is true, that the Lord in mercie for Chriſt coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the ſinnes of his, but it is as true, that the Lorde cureth the ſinnes of his. It cannot be denyed, but that for Chriſte, he doeth pardon the ſinnes of his ſeruantes, neither may we deny, but that in Chriſt he doeth alſo purge the ſinnes of his ſeruants. Let vs therefore (brethren) reſorte vnto God by faithful prayer, that as he hath taken away the condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſinne, ſo he would more and more abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh the rule and kingdome thereof. Our hope is great, for our promiſes are many: our capteine is ſtronge, our enemie hath often beene foyled, euen in fraile fleſh as feeble as we bee: but the conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors haue euer beene careful, much giuen to vſe the meanes of the word and prayer, often in the fielde with their owne affections, hauing vpon them the compleate harneſſe of a Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>Now let vs pray vnto our heauenly father, that wee may ſo ſee our wante of faithe, that wee may truely magnifie the grace and mercie of GOD in Chriſte, whiche couereth the imperfection thereof: and alſo that we may haue ſuch ſtrength from the power of his death, that by the meanes thereof we may more and more preuaile bothe ouer our miſtruſtful nature in want, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ouer our careleſſe and ſecure eſtate in plentie and abundance.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lbeit the time would nor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit me to ſpeake the laſte day of the third verſe, but forced me to reſerue it vnto this day, and to ioyne it with this matter that now you haue heard (of not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to our ſelues any grauen image) yet that whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che time hath nowe knitte together, is by the iudgement of diuerſe godlie and learned men, not to be ſundered at all. For they take that (of hauing the Lord our God) which hath already beene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, to be the firſte commaundement, and this Scripture that now I haue read, conteyned in theſe
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:7047:20"/>
foure verſes, to be the ſeconde. Of this iudgement was that learned Father Peter Martyr,<note place="margin">Rom. 7.</note> whoſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des are theſe in his Commentarie vppon the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes. I ſuppoſe the firſte commaundement to be that which is ſett before the reſte in ſteade of a proheme, <hi>I am the Lorde thy GOD whiche haue brought thee out of the lande of Aegypt.</hi> For in theſe wordes are we commaunded to accompt him for the true God, and that we ſhoulde not thinke that he is to bee worſhipped together with other Gods, ſtraight way is added the ſecond precepte, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in wee are prohibited to worſhip ſtraunge Gods, and grauen thinges and images, and if a man will more narrowly conſider the thing, he ſhall ſee that together with this firſt comaundemente is offered vnto vs the Goſpell, for in it GOD promiſeth that he will be our God. Theſe are the wordes of Peter Martyr.</p>
            <p>Of this iudgement in like manner was that lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and godlie man M. Bucer, as appeareth in his expoſition vpon 24. Pſalme, where hee hath theſe wordes. The firſt thing of all in the matter of our ſaluation, is to beleeue in one Lorde our GOD, from whome as the fathers had their deliuerance from Aegypt and all other bleſſinges beſide, ſo wee all receiue the good things that we haue, whiche is taught in the firſte of the ten commaundementes, that is to ſay, in this, <hi>I the Lord am thy GOD whiche brought thee out of the land of Aegypt.</hi> The ſeconde co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement is to ioyne no feigned God with the true GOD, which mans madneſſe is alwayes
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:7047:20"/>
accuſtomed to do: neither were theſe men alone of this iudgement, but followed in it the opinion of ſome of the beſt learned among the interpreters of the Hebrue, who doe thus diuide theſe two com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements, taking y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> of making grauen images to be a braunch of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſecond co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement, which forbiddeth vs either to ioyne any falſe God to the only true Lord, or to worſhip y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true God with any falſe worſhip deuiſed of our ſelues, &amp; not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him. For as it followeth in that place whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che now I cited out of M. Bucer, the blindenes of man is accuſtomed to giue ſo much to his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſes, in ioyning ſome in worſhip with God, or to that which he hath deuiſed for the worſhip of god, that he wil not depend vpon the mere goodnes of God alone. And for the moſte parte (ſaith he) they ſeke by ſuch ceremonies to pacifie the lord, whom they do perceiue to be offended with their wicked life, which thing hath greater blaſphemie in it then we can conceiue of. It is moſt ſure that when once man dare aduenture, to put others in the honour of worſhip with the Lorde (whiche thing he hath forbide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) he wil not be afraid to bring vpon him an other worſhip then he hath commaunded: theſe bothe come from one corrupte beginning, as ſhall (God willing) heereafter more plentifully appeere.</p>
            <p>We are in this commaundement forbidden to worſhip any together with him, or to admitt any worſhip of him, beſides his owne whiche he hath lefte vs in his worde, the Lorde therefore woulde haue vs to ſeeke al good things at his hands alone,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:7047:21"/>
and cannot abide that we ſhould haue other Gods before his face, or vppon his face, for this interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation will bothe the wordes and the meaning beare very well: as if he ſhould ſay, In as muche as I haue taken vpon me to care for you, and to honour my ſelfe by ſhewing foorth the treaſures of my grace vpon you, it ſhall not be lawfull for to darken the light of my goodneſſe, by ſeking to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine that at the hands of any other, the gift wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I haue reſerued to my ſelfe alone, for the glorie and praiſe of the riches of my grace. For I doe you to vnderſtand, that when ſoeuer you ſeeke to any other then me, for any parte of your welfare, you doe as it were drawe a corteine ouer my face, that I cannot be ſeene in the full ſhewe of my mercie, howe I am affected towardes you, while they by ſtepping betweene, conuey ſome praiſe of the gifte and mercie to them ſelues. Heere we ſee all paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to the virgine Marie, Angels or Saintes what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer, to be ſtopped vpp, and the way to GOD opened vnto all, in their neceſſities to run thyther, with an aſſured hope of comforte, by reaſon of the promiſe.</p>
            <p>When Sathan would haue obteyned of our ſauiour Chriſte, a parte in the honour of worſhip, he telleth him it was written:<note place="margin">Matt. 4.10.</note> 
               <hi>Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God &amp; him alone ſhalt thou ſerue,</hi> the anſwere of our ſauiour Chriſt being according to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and demaund, telleth vs that Sathan would not haue refuſed to haue had the Lord worſhipped, ſo that he might haue obteyned to haue beene parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:7047:21"/>
with him in it. It declareth alſo that not only the Lord refuſeth to haue Sathan, but alſo any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther whoſoeuer, to be worſhipped with him. for it is written, <hi>Him alone ſhalt thou ſerue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Inuocation therefore and prayer, beeing a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip that the Lord preferreth aboue ſacryfice, may not be giuen to any Sainct or Virgin, but muſte be reſerued vnto the Lord alone, who will not haue his grace darckened, or his glorie parted with any. Neither can he ſuffer that the virgin Marie, or any ſaint or angel ſhould co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e into any opinion of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, either aboue him, or equall with him: whiche muſt be grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted, if this be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſed, that it is lawful to call vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For why ſhould we come in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er vnto them, if he who is of greater power to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourme our requeſt, be alſo of more mercie to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline fauourably to our demaunds? This reſorting therefore vnto them by prayer, hath in it a plaine profeſſion, that they are more redily inclined vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to compaſſion, then the Lord: which in deed deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him to be God. For he is not the true God, if any do exceede him in mercie and compaſſion. It cannot be that the Lord ſhould be God, if any be found his ſuperiour or match in mercie, wherein conſiſteth his chiefe glorie. But of this (God wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling) more ſhall be ſpoken when I come to ſpeake of prayer:<note place="margin">Rom. 5.</note> And yet it may not be forgotten that in dying for vs when we were enimyes vnto him, he lefte that patterne of mercie behinde him, the like whereof hath not beene hearde or ſeene in any: which cannot but leade vs in beliefe to hope for
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:7047:22"/>
more mercy from him, then from any other. If a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thinke that prayer is not ſuche worſhip of God wherewith he is ſo delighted, but that he can bee content that others, as Sainctes or Angels, ſhould alſo haue that honour: let them peruſe the 50. Pſalme, and they ſhall finde that the Lorde pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth this ſeruice of his (to bee called vppon in neceſſitie) aboue all ſacrifice and outwarde wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. The Churche of Rome will not giue out licence to offer ſacrifice vnto Saintes that bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from this life, and yet the Lord ſetteth pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer in dignitie aboue ſacrifice, making it a ſeruice that doth more honour him, then doth that other.</p>
            <p>For what greater honour can he haue, then to bee magnified in this greatneſſe of his mercie, that hee ſhoulde bee the onely ſanctuarie for the diſtreſſed in their calamitie. The Angels them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues haue refuſed to bee worſhipped of men, knowing that the Lorde wil not haue his glorie parted vnto others.<note place="margin">Reue. 22.8.</note> In the Reuelatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Iohn profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth that he fell down to worſhipp before the feete of the Angel, and that the Angel ſaide vnto him, Se thou do it not, for I am thy fellow ſeruant, and the fellow ſeruaunt of thy brethren the prophets, and of them which keepe the words of this book: Worſhip God. The Angel refuſeth worſhippe, placeth himſelfe as a ſeruaunt among them that ſerue the Lord after his worde, and chargeth him to worſhip God. Let vs learne to bridle this affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that ſeeketh to be approued vnder the title of a good intent: for it is a ſtrong perſuaſion to the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:7047:22"/>
fleaſhe, that the Lorde cannot refuſe, but well like of whatſoeuer worſhipp wee offer, ſo it bee to no other, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoſe that are beloued of him, of whom he hath declared his likeing by graces and gyftes graunted vnto them in greater meaſure, then vnto the common ſort of his ſeruauntes. We may well ſuſpect our infirmitie, when the Euangeliſt Iohn was almoſt carried away with his weakneſſe in this parte. For the infirmitie of the fleſh reaſoneth thus. Can it be any offence to honour &amp; aduance them whome God himſelfe hath honoured? Hath not God himſelf declared by his graces giuen vnto them, what reckoning he maketh of them? Can we make too much of them, whome God ſo tenderly loueth? Theſe are the pathes of good intents wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering without the worde: Nay, they proceede further. If wee ſhall be approued of the Lorde, wee muſt creepe into fauour with thoſe that are deere vnto him: and the next way to haue fauour with him, is to growe into the fauour of thoſe that are neere aboute him, according as the practiſe is to get the good lykings of men, that are of greate calling heere in earth, by growing into the lyking of thoſe their ſeruantes, that can doe moſte of all with them. But we are taught of the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, that his wayes differ from oures as farre as Heauen differeth from the earth, and that the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens are not ſo farre in height aboue the Earth, as are his thoughts aboue oures. So that wee offer exceeding wronge vnto his maieſtie, while we thinke to bring him vnder the condition of mans
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:7047:23"/>
infirmitie, whoſe good countenance cannot be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned, vnleſſe in the perſons of thoſe whome hee eſpecially lyketh of (by brybing or flattering of them) he him ſelfe may ſeeme to be honoured, and the holde of his fauour craftily vndermined.</p>
            <p>The word of the Lord ſhaketh off all ſuch fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, telling vs, that it is the hearing of his worde &amp; keeping of the ſame y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> getteth credite with him that maketh vs allied vnto him: euen to become truely the mother, ſiſter, or brother of him: as wee read in the goſpell after S. Luke,<note place="margin">Luke. 8.21.</note> in the which place he doeth ſo commend this kinred (as I may call it) of his worde, that he maketh no reckoning of any other, but in reſpect of that. Wherein hee doeth notably reproue the fooliſhe fancie of fleaſhe and bloud which imagine that they can offer nothing vnto the virgin Marie, wherin they ſhall not binde him vnto them: the Lord therefore is conſtrained to ſignifie, that thoſe naturall reſpects preuaile not with him, as with weake men, but that the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of his worde and doeing of the ſame, is all in all with him, and the onely worſhip that plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth him, which when it is wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting, he accepteth of no ſeruice, haue it neuer ſo greate ſhewe of mans reaſon for it.</p>
            <p>As wee may not take vpon vs to worſhip any beſides the Lorde, no more is it lawfull for vs to giue any worſhip to the Lord, but onely that whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che is allowed in his word: and therefore hath he forbidden vs to make any grauen image, imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that way to pleaſe him, and to doe a worke
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:7047:23"/>
that is acceptable vnto him. For thoſe that bow vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to grauen Images, thincke and ſay that the Lorde is ſerued therein, and that they doe it not vnto the Image, but vnto the Lorde repreſented vnto them in the Image: but the Lorde in this commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement forbiddeth as well the falſe worſhip of the true GOD, as the giuinge of any parte of his true worſhip vnto a falſe God, I meane vnto any beſides the onely true God. It commeth all from one founteine, to dare be bolde to giue vnto him any worſhip beſide that which he hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded, and to worſhip any other beſides himſelfe: which thinge he hath in many places plainely forbidden, &amp; therefore in this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundemente he repreſſeth this intollerable boldneſſe of man, that in his owne deuotion will preſume to pleaſe the Lorde, either in the worſhipping of others, or in any other ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of worſhipping him, than he himſelfe hath o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in his worde. In this ſeconde parte (concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge grauen Images) there are certeine wordes, which beeing layde open, will make the better en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance to the true ſenſe and meaning of the whole: in conſideration whereof, it ſhall not be vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, briefely and in a worde to touch them. It is ſaide here that he is <hi>A ielous God:</hi> which ſignifieth, that he can not ſuffer vs to ioyne any with him, in the cauſe &amp; care of our welfare. A kinde of ſpeach borrowed from husbandes: who can not abide to ſee the mindes &amp; affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of their wiues entang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with any other men, but require to haue them kepte pure and chaſte to them ſelues alone. The
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:7047:24"/>
purſuing of his diſpleaſure (whiche is heere reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) towarde the thirde and fourth generation of them that hate him, ſeeming to maintaine vnrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes in the Lord, is to be vnderſtoode of ſuch children, as treade in the ſame ſtepps of iniquitie with their fathers. For otherwiſe that of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Ezechiel is true,<note place="margin">Eze. 18.20.</note> The godly ſonne ſhall not beare the iniquitie of his vngodly father.</p>
            <p>Theſe thinges beeing now made plaine vnto vs, let vs goe forwarde with the matter that wee haue in hand. The Lorde God in forbidding the worſhipping of images, and ſo vnder that, all other kinde of worſhip inuented by man, addeth this reaſon to diſuade vs from it, becauſe hee is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come our God, who is iealous ouer vs, and cannot abide that wee go after any other: this reaſon to diſuade vs from idolatrie, maintaining ſuche ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der affection of God towardes his as cannot ſuffer them to looke aſide after any other, becauſe hee woulde haue them, as they are in deed, ſo to take them ſelues wholy beholden to him, argueth that Idolaters and falſe worſhippers of God, are ſo ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed away with the loue and affection that they beare vnto thoſe whome they worſhip with the LORDE, and with the opinion of that their deuiſed worſhippe of him, that they depende not wholy vppon his goodneſſe, takinge him alone to bee their whole happineſſe, the onely au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor and worker thereof, but are parted and diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in their affection, imagining and perſuading
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:7047:24"/>
them ſelues that they are beholden, and that not a little, (for the benefites they haue what ſoeuer) vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe whome they worſhip, and vnto this their deuiſed ſeruice of the Lorde.</p>
            <p>This thinge is notably declared by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Hoſea:<note place="margin">Hoſea. 2.5</note> where the Idolatrie of the Iſraelites is reſembled in the adultereſſe and whoriſh wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that ſayeth plainely ſhee will goe after her louers which gaue her breade, wooll &amp; flaxe. <hi>Their mother</hi> (ſayth the Lorde by his Prophet) <hi>hath pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yed the harlot, ſhee that conceiued them hath doone ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, for ſhe ſaide I will go after my louers that gaue me my bread and my water, my wooll &amp; my flaxe, mine oyle and my drinke.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is the perſuaſion of the Idolaters, that the bleſſinges whiche they haue are the giftes and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes of thoſe whome they worſhippe, and of that their deuiſed worſhippe. It is yet a common thinge in the mouthes of many, that the worlde was good when men worſhipped Sainctes and Images: there was plentie of all thinges, ſo that euen now we may deſcry the whore by her won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſpeeche, <hi>I will goe after my louers that gaue me my wooll and my flaxe, mine oyle and my drink.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the 8. verſe of this Chapter the Lorde ſayeth plainly by his Prophet, <hi>That this whore did not knowe that it was he that gaue her corne, and wine, and oyle, and multiplied her ſiluer and goulde, which was beſtowed vppon Baal.</hi> It doeth plainely appeere by this, that the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolaters are drawen in their hart and affection vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe whome they worſhip, nouriſhing a ſecret
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:7047:25"/>
perſuaſion that they haue their benefites from thence: whereby it commeth to paſſe, that their hearts departe by little and little from the Lord. We haue a plain profe of this in Poperie, not only by their ſpeache that ſay, while they worſhipped Sainctes they had ſtore and plentie of all thinges, but alſo by their practiſe, who had aſſigned vnto ſeuerall Sainctes the honor of help and aide in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall cauſes of diſtreſſe. To ſome they aſſigned the charge for agues, to others for the frutes of rhe earth, and to ſeuerall kingdomes &amp; countries they aſſigne ſeuerall Sainctes for patrones. To theſe they did reſorte in diſtreſſes, theſe they called vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, when any help came, they receiued it as the benefite of that Sainct to whom they had allotted that charge. Thus hauing diſtributed Gods office vnto others, and hauing put ouer the diſtribution of ſeuerall benefites vnto ſeuerall Sainctes, and (as men that tendred the trouble of the Lorde) ſet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſte ouer all dealings vnto other vnder him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any way releeued, the honour therof if it were not altogether giuen away from the Lorde, at leaſt it muſt be parted: ſo that it cannot be but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> talke of the whore, <hi>That ſhe will go after her louers, that haue gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen her her oyle and drinke, her woll and flaxe.</hi> For to what ende ſhould ſhe ſo reſorte vnto them, if ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing helpe that way, ſhe meant not to returne the honor vppon them. The trueth is ſo, that worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping any beſides the Lorde, as alſo in giuing him any worſhip of their owne deuiſing not confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in his worde, they are caryed ſo away with
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:7047:25"/>
the opinion and worthineſſe thereof, that they do not wholy depend vpon the goodnes of the Lord, therefore we ſhall finde it often in the ſcriptures where the Lord laboreth to ouerthrowe Idolatrie and worſhipping of Images: in the ſame place he magnifieth his owne goodnes and his alone good<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes towards them, a notable confirmation where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we haue in the prophet Eſay ſpeaking of them that ſet vp the woods of their Idol:<note place="margin">Eſai. 45.21.</note> Immediatly vppon it he hath theſe words, <hi>There is none other God beſides me, A iuſt God, and a Sauiour: there is none beſide mee. Looke vnto mee, and yee ſhall bee ſaued: all the endes of the earth ſhall be ſaued, for I am God, and there is none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. I haue ſworne by my ſelfe: the worde is gone out of my mouth in righteouſnes, and ſhall not returne, that euerie knee ſhall bow vnto me, and euery tongue ſhall ſweare by me. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he ſhall ſay, In the Lorde haue I righteouſnes and ſtrength, he ſhall come vnto him, and all that prouoke him, ſhall bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed. The whole ſeede of Iſrael ſhall be iuſtified and glorie in the Lord.</hi> It is worthy the diligent conſideration, that in depreſſing of idolatrie and falſe worſhipp, he ariſeth to mainteine our iuſtification, ſtrength and glorie to be in the Lorde alone, and vs ſo to profeſſe it, that vve glorie for that we haue righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes and ſtrength in the Lorde: which proueth plainely, that Idolaters are not ſo perſuaded, but that in the opinion of theſe their doinges,<note place="margin">Eſai. 44.21.</note> their affection abateth towardes the goodnes of the Lorde. The like confirmation we haue in an other place of the ſame prophet, where diſuading the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from idolatrie, he ſetteth forth the greatnes of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:7047:26"/>
his goodneſſe towardes them. <hi>Remember theſe (Oh Iacob and Iſrael) for thou art my ſeruaunt: I haue fourmed thee, Thou art my ſeruant: O Iſrael forget me not: I haue put away thy tranſgreſsions like a cloude, and thy ſinnes as a myſte: turne vnto mee for I haue redeemed thee.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as before the greate and vndeſerued goodneſſe of the Lord is brought in as the beſt medicine to cure idolatrie. True it is therefore, whatſoeuer they do ſay, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they ſo truſt vnto theſe vntoward deuiſed thinges which they doe vnto God, that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pende not wholy vppon his meere and alone goodneſſe, as they who take their happineſſe one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ariſe from thence: and that is the cauſe, why in dealing with them, he vpholdeth the great<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſſe of his goodneſſe, and of his alone goodneſſe towardes them, whiche carrieth in it a ſecrete ſentence againſt them, that they ſtande not perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded &amp; reſolued therof. Idolatrie is moſt fitly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared in the ſcripture vnto adulterie, and the Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters called whoores, becauſe as whoores admitte vnto their loue others than their owne huſbandes, ſo Idolaters, and the falſe worſhippers of God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue not their faith and confidence vnto the Lord alone, but permit others to be fellowes with him at the ſame. Wherefore to declare the great hatred that he hath of ſuch dealing he taketh vnto him the quarell of ielouſie threatening that he will proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quute this iniurie of proſtituting and laying open that faith vnto others which is due vnto him, euen vnto the third and fourth generation of them that ſhalbe founde tranſgreſſours herein calling them
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:7047:26"/>
haters of him, who are not by faith (the very knot of this ſpirituall wedlocke) ſurely knit vnto him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone. He can no more abide to heare of any that ſhould be fellowes with him at our faith, than the honeſt man can abide to heare, that another beſides himſelfe, ſhould haue the enterteinment of an huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band with his wife. It is diligently to be obſerued that he calleth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haters of him who ſhal thus di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide their affection from him. The moſt that they can ſay, for this their worſhippe is, that it commeth from a good meaning &amp; intent, &amp; this perſuadeth the moſte of them well of it: For God (ſay they) cannot of his mercie refuſe that which is wel ment &amp; intended towarde him: The Lord therfore vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly ouerthroweth this defence, ſaying in expreſſe wordes, that they be haters of him, &amp; ſo ledd with the liking of their worſhip, from the Lord and his true ſeruice, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> when occaſion ſerueth, they bewray extreame hatred therevnto, proſequuting it with fire &amp; fagot in the true profeſſours thereof. This ſin of idolatrie and falſe worſhip of God, is diligently to be conſidered of, that we may ſee the danger of it, and keepe vs from tranſgreſsing therein. The daunger of this ſinne, &amp; the greatneſſe therof, we can not better diſcerne, than by the puniſhment executed againſt it from the iuſt Lorde: who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is iuſt and Iuſtice it ſelfe, cannot appointe puniſhment, but according to the nature and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of the offence, he threateneth that the fire of his ielouſie ſhal burne vpon the poſteritie of thoſe that offende therein, vnto the thirde and fourth
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:7047:27"/>
generation. Greate muſte that ſinne bee, the flame of whoſe puniſhment caſteth out ſmoke ſo long. The greatnes of the puniſhment may lead vs to ſe the heynouſneſſe of that offence of Idolatrie and ſeruing of God by good intentes. The fire of Gods wrath beeing kindled by this ſinne, as wee ſee, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be quenched many generations after the death of them that haue beene the firſte tranſgreſſours in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame. The lord declareth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reaſon by his prophet Hoſea why he will thus puniſhe the poſteritie of the idolaters,<note place="margin">Hoſea. 2.4.</note> 
               <hi>I wil haue no pitie vpon her children</hi> (ſaith the Lord by the prophet) <hi>becauſe they be the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of fornication,</hi> declaring y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hee may lawfully diſinherit them, becauſe they are none of his, but children be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten in fornication. The ſtate of the children of Iſrael in the captiuitie of Babylon euen vntill the comming of Chriſte may fitly ſhadowe out vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs the truth of this puniſhment threatened here for idolatrie. For albeit there was a returne fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon, yet we knowe that the number was ſmall that returned, and ſubiect vnto greate miſery euen vntil the comming of Chriſt, beſide their puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in the want of temporall benefites. The lord thretned by his prophet Hoſea according as he did perfourme in deede,<note place="margin">Hoſea. 2.11.</note> that he would no more ſuffer them to inioye the vſe of his worſhippe, <hi>I will cauſe (ſaith the Lord) al her mirth to ceaſe, her feaſt days, her new Moones and her Sabbaoths, and al her ſolemne feaſts.</hi> And in the thirde chapter, the Lorde in like manner de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth,<note place="margin">Hoſea. 3.4.</note> that the children of Iſrael ſhal remain ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny daies without a king, &amp; alſo without an offring</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:7047:27"/>Long before their captiuitie, they had nothing beſide the outwarde ſhew and ceremonies of the worſhip of God, which alſo vtterly ceaſſed when they were led into baniſhment: yet the comforte came which was promiſed in the latter time vnto their poſteritie, according as it was fore-told them by the Prophete: but greate was that ſinne that procured ſo long laſting puniſhmente vppon their poſteritie, and ſo greate a puniſhment, that they ſhould be diuorced from the Lord. For he affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth this by his Prophet, that he wil marrie them vnto him for euer, declaring thereby that they had bene diuorced before. But we need not take exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of God his puniſhment of Idolatrie from the people of Iſrael, (wanting, beſide other benefites, the true worſhippe of God ſo long time:) Poperie in theſe laſt times may be a true ſpectacle thereof, where y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> declining from true religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath brought ſo miſerable blindeneſſe, continuing ſo many ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations. The Papiſtes now in the latter dayes of the Goſpel, after this as it were ſolemnizing of the marriage againe betweene the Lord and his Church, require to knowe where the Church was before this time of the Goſpel: as if ſome of the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites, after that the Lorde had returned vnto them in mercie and betrothed them a newe vnto himſelfe againe, ſhould haue required where the Church had beene in their captiuitie, when they wanted the ſacrifice and offeringes, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Sabbaothes, new moones, and all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true outwarde worſhip of God: calling into queſtion the trueth of that true
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:7047:28"/>
worſhip and ſeruice of God, becauſe they had been ſo long without it before. Thoſe times of Poperie were the times of idolatrie and puniſhment of the Lord for idolatrie: they were (as I may call it) the widowhoode or rather the diuorced eſtate of the churche, when (notwithſtanding the Lorde did beare loue and ſecrete liking vnto thoſe that were his) yet was their outward eſtate the condition of a widowe, or rather of a diuorced woman, hauing in it the badge of diſpleaſure and puniſhment from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord. To require therfore y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this our time ſhould bee confourmed in worſhippe vnto that, is to like of diuorcement better then marriage, &amp; to craue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the vnlawful libertie of the one may be a paterne &amp; warrant to diſſolue the godly and lawful bonde of the other. The Lord affirmeth likewiſe that he <hi>Wil ſhewe mercie vnto thouſandes of them whiche loue him, and keepe his commandementes:</hi> wherein he noteth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs two properties in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true worſhip of God, the firſt is the loue of him, the ſeconde the keeping of his commandementes: wherof the firſt, (that is the loue of him) openeth vnto vs what beginning true worſhippe hath: and the ſeconde (which is the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of things pleaſaunt in his ſight) telleth vs by what rule that worſhippe doth proceede, euen by his word, which truely diſcouereth what thinges are pleaſing or diſpleaſing vnto him.

This loue proceedeth to the doeing of thoſe thinges that are acceptable in the ſighte of God: for it is the ſecond note of the true worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of God to keep his commandements, &amp; to go to the ſeruice of God, not at aduenture directed by the line of our owne deuotion, but by the leuell of

his word and commaundement, wherein alſo falſe worſhippers are greately deceiued: for as their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning is euil, becauſe it floweth not from loue to God, ſo their proceeding is as daungerous, in that they followe not the rule of his worde.

And therefore the ſeruing of God by Images, as it hath often in the Scripture, the goodneſſe of God ſet againſt it, for the redreſſe thereof, (in that the not reſtinge therin hath begotten it) ſo hath it alſo the word of God often times in the Scripture to correct it as not proceeding by the right rule. Therefore in Deuterono.<note place="margin">Deu. 4.12.</note> when the Lord was about to preſcribe the manner of his worſhip, it is ſaid thus: <hi>You heard a voice, but ſaw no ſimilitude: Take therefore good heed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your ſelues, for you ſawe no Image in the day that the Lord ſpake vnto you in Horeb,</hi> where the holie Ghoſte ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the practiſe and example of Almightie God, in opening himſelfe by his worde, and not by any ſimilitude, a ſufficient declaration that his wil was we ſhould be directed by his worde, and not by I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages in the ſeruice of him.</p>

affection, and wil not be ſo negligent as whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with a little paines he may learne his diſpoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, raſhly to aduenture y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doing of that which (for any thing he knoweth to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> contrarie) may poſſibly procure his heauie diſpleaſure. This is not humilitie, but pride &amp; dangerous ſecuritie, reſtrayning the Lord to our lyking, &amp; not conforming our ſelues to the good pleaſure of his wil. Out of this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>man dement we may learne a notable differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce betwene the church of God, &amp; the ſynagogue of ſathan. The church of God loueth God, and keepeth his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements, ſhe is that chaſte wife, that admitteth none beſide the Lord into the felowſhip of her faith: ſhe bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vp her young ones vnto the lyking of him, fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them with the ſound milke of the word. The church of Antichriſte keepeth not her ſelfe to her huſband alone, but admitteth others to the vſe of her faith, and therefore in the ſcripture is ſhe fitly reſembled vnto an harlot: neither doeth ſhe nurce vp her yong ones after the lyking of her huſband, with the wholeſome doctrine of the olde and new Teſtament, (which Auguſtine doth call very fitly, the two pappes of the Churche:) but with the peſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilente poyſon of good intentes, teaching them from their infancie to followe her foote-ſteppes in going a whooreing after their owne eyes, and after their owne heart, whiche are the very ſteppes of an harlot, as was euen now proued vnto vs out of the Booke of Numbers. Our nature is corrupt in this commaundement, as in all the reſte, and greatly pleaſeth it ſelfe in thinges that it doeth of a
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:7047:30"/>
good meaning and intent vnto the Lorde, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding whether they ſtand approued by his word or no, holding this as a true principle, that the thing can neuer be euill taken of the Lord, whiche is well ment of man. The man that will truely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine him ſelfe in this commaundement, muſte throughly conſider of the former time of his life, when hee hath occupyed him ſelfe in outwarde things, not warranted by the worde, and yet repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of him as the ſpeciall pleaſing of God: nay vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the defence and ſhadowe of thoſe thinges, hath beene the more careleſſe to ſeeke out and practiſe the duties of the worde: remembring that ſuche ſeruice of GOD, deſerueth to haue a curſſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing vppon his poſteritie vnto many generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Thus ſhall he eaſily perceiue what is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite that he hath by the mediatour Chriſt Ieſus: for the law driueth him therevnto by opening his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in this manner, and letting him ſee y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there is no helpe but in the alone redeemer Chriſt Ieſus: when in him ſelfe he doeth truely vnderſtand that he is only beholden vnto the Lord for his ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he muſt begin to warr with his affections that would ſhake of obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſhadowe of good intent &amp; deuotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, occupying it ſelfe in trifling out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde thinges, and neuer drawing neere vnto the Lord in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dueties laide vpon him by the word, he muſt labour diligently to finde out the wil of God in his word, for no other end but that hee may be a doer and follower of the ſame, his profiting, how greate ſo euer it bee, is not without infirmitie,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:7047:31"/>
and therefore hee is not without humilitie in his beſt doings: his offending at any time cannot bee without griefe, for hee ſeeth in it the diſhonour of his merciful father, whoſe free mercie is his ſtay. Let vs learne (brethren) to take heed in ſeruing the Lord in a deuotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that agreeth not with his word. What will it auayle to ſay, We do it of loue and good meaning towards him, when the Lord hath ſaid, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all ſuch are haters of him? Shall our mening, condemne the trueth of his ſaying? Or ſhall that be good meaning when we come to true reckoning which the Lorde hath pronounced to be hateing? Let man be afraid to beare hatred againſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord, and therefore let him feare to ſerue him with good intents beſides his worde. If man ſhould bee ſo obſtinate in euill, that he feareth no puniſhment in reſpect of himſelfe, imagining his life to make an end of all his affliction: yet let him fear the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente of this ſinne, that will not leaue him in the graue, but ſet the marke of his iniquitie vppon his children and poſteritie vnto many generations.</p>
            <p>I neede not greatly to ſpeake vnto the moſte that be heere, that they ſhould leaue thoſe fooliſh works of deuotion and good meaning, as going on Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage, ſetting vp of ſhrynes, and ſuch like things receiued amongſt the Papiſtes. His name be pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that madneſſe is deſcryed, and a great number of them ſelues begin now to bluſh at it: but the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde ceremonies of Religion, as reſorting to common prayer, hearing of Sermons, or ſuche o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, theſe haue obteyned now the title of the true

ſeruice of GOD, and ſhut out the obedience vnto the dueties commaunded by the word. Theſe hold men now from care of dueties appointed by the word, as deuiſed deuotion kept them in Poperie, from true religion. Theſe are the good intentes of Goſpellers at this day, and as the Lorde ſpake of his ſacrifices commaunded in his worde, when me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were holden in thoſe without any care of good life. <hi>He that killeth a Bullock, is as if he ſlue a man,</hi>

The meanes to auoid the dangers of our deuiſes in the ſeruice of GOD, and to haue diſcloſed vnto vs the ſubtilties and ſnares thereof,<note place="margin">Pro. 2.10.</note> is to delight in the wiſdome of the worde, to be much exerciſed therein, according as it is declared in the booke of Prouerbes, <hi>That when wiſdome entreth into the hearte, and knowledge delighteth the ſoule, then ſhall it deliuer vs from the euill way, and from the ſtraunge woman, whiche forſaketh the guide of her youth.</hi>

            <p>The ſame wordes <hi>(Obſerue to do)</hi> are vſed in the firſt verſe of the ſame Chapter, and therefore not lightlie to be regarded of vs, beeing ſo often noted by the holie ghoſte.

And no meruaile: for in very deed God hath no ſeruice in trueth, where this godly care is wanting: it is no prayer that is not a careful prayer: he neuer obteyneth, that hath no deſire to obteine. When workes (of them ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues good) are done without any great care to haue them doone, the ſame may haue prayſe for doe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but the heart can claime nothing for any care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full purpoſing.</p>

            <p>For heerein is the care and feare of a ſeruaunt diſtinguiſhed and diſcerned from the care and feare of a Sonne, that the ſonnes care and feare he hath of his Father is ioyned with loue, and ary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth thereof, and proceedeth thereby to pleaſe him: The Seruauntes care and feare aryſeth in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecte of puniſhment if hee diſpleaſe his maiſter, or elſe from the hope of wages if happily hee may pleaſe him in his ſeruice.

            <p>Hereby alſo we are taught to ceaſſe to meruaile at the afflictions of thoſe men, in whoſe liues we haue eſpied no great outwarde offence.

                  </gap>.</note> For thus we do read in the Prophet Eſay, <hi>Bleſſed is the man that doeth this, and the Sonne of man that taketh holde on it, he that keepeth
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:7047:41"/>
the Sabbaoth and polluteth it not, and keepeth his hand from dooeing any euill.</hi> The Prophete doeth declare, what it is to keepe the Sabbaoth, by theſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des following, <hi>And keepeth his hand from doeing any euil.</hi> The euill that by this ſabbaoth we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded to reſt and ceaſſe from, is not a matter ſtraunge and diſagreeing from our diſpoſition, but rooted in our nature: as nowe we haue it from A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam. And therefore the ſame Prophet that here af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth the keeping of the Sabbaoth to conſiſt in ceaſsing and reſting from euill,<note place="margin">Eſai. 58.13.</note> in an other place af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth it to be the ceaſsing from our owne wayes and workes: declaring thereby this euill and ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie (that we are commaunded to ceaſſe from) to be no forrener or ſtraunger, but to keepe his houſe and home in our owne nature. In that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture termeth euil to be our own wayes and works, according as it is written by the Prophete Iſaie, <hi>If thou conſecrate the Sabbaoth as glorious vnto the Lorde, and ſhalt honour him,</hi>

               <hi>not doing thine owne wayes, nor ſeeking thine owne will, &amp;c.</hi> expounding the <hi>Not doing our owne ways, nor ſeeking our owne will,</hi> to be the conſecrating of a glorious Sabbaoth vnto the Lord. The Sabbaoth then conſiſteth in keeping vs from doing euil, ſo that neceſſarily we muſt conclude this euil to be in our owne wills and wayes. This inwarde cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, wherewith bothe our wit and wil is poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned, was very fitly reſembled in the outward ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruing of the Sabbaoth. For vppon the Sabbaoth day, the people were called from all their accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med workes, that they had beene occupied in the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:7047:41"/>
ſixe dayes before. So that a man comparing their doinges that day, with thoſe they were exerciſed in the other ſixe dayes, muſt of neceſſitie ſay they were cleane altered and chaunged in their doinges, from that, that vſually before they had beene, and ſo diuerſe, as if they had not beene the ſame, but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men. A reſemblance verie fitte and ſitting to our ſpirituall Sabbaoth, whiche conſiſteth in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comming newe men concerning our dooinges, from that wee haue beene, before wee knewe the Goſpell. The outward reſt from bodily laboures, whiche did ſhadowe out our true reſt from ſinne, (whiche is our accuſtomed way and worke) was ſo ſtrictely obſerued among the Iewes, that the neglect thereof in the leaſt thinges, (as gathering ſticks vpon the Sabbaoth day) was puniſhed with death: as we do reade in the 15. of Numbers, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare ſome ſignification of greater thinges in it,<note place="margin">Num. 15.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

it to haue beene done by following the wil of the minde, (whiche is the reaſonable part:) as well as in following the will of the fleſh, (which is the affection &amp; vnreaſonable part.) And leſt we ſhuld aſcribe this only to his cuſtome in ſinne, (as if hee had not beene borne with this diſeaſe, nor by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture inclined therevnto,) he putteth himſelfe and others vnder the wrathe of God by nature, ſaying: We are by nature the children of wrath as well as others: making it the common caſe of all men, as naturally to be inclined to euill, as they are to eate and drinke in their hunger or thirſt. It is worth the noting y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he putteth himſelfe in the number, for he ſaith of him ſelfe to the Philippians,<note place="margin">Philip. 3.6.</note> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his life was not outwardly to be reproued, no not before his calling. And therefore we may learne, that this is the eſtate, euen of thoſe ciuil men, that are not to be touched with any notorious offence or outward euill.</p>
            <p>This Sabbaoth, teaching vs our inward corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſtayeth not there, neither is that the end of it, but leadeth vs to vnderſtand, that our iuſtification, ſanctification, and true holineſſe of life, are the free works of God within vs: which we are compelled to grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we confeſſe our own ways to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ceaſsing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſinn, is the ceaſsing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our own ways &amp; works. For if (as the truth is) our owne wayes be al corrupted &amp; defiled with ſinne, if any good be in vs, it muſt haue a beginning and ſpring other where then from our ſelues. That

the Sabdaoth did ſignifie our newe birth in Chriſt to be the workmanſhip of God within vs, may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in Exodus. <hi>Keepe ye my Sabbaoth,</hi>

               <hi>for it is a ſigne betweene me and you in your generations, that you may know that I the Lord do ſanctifie you.</hi> For the deniall of their owne wayes, muſt needes witneſſe theire woorkes of ſanctification to proceede from the Lorde, and not of them ſelues. The ſame is witneſſed in Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiel, and in the Actes of the Apoſtles.<note place="margin">Ezech 20.12 Actes. 3.26.</note> The coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunt made with Abraham for bleſſing all nations in his ſeede, is ſaide to be perfourmed in Chriſt, in turning euerie one of his from their iniquitie. <hi>Vnto you</hi> (ſaith the holy ghoſt in that place) <hi>hath God rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vp his ſonne Ieſus.

            <p>There is mention made in this commandement, of the Lords creation of the worlde in ſixe dayes: as if the Sabbaoth ſhould only direct vs to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of that worke of our creation, not requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring any thing beſide: eſpecially, ſeeing there fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth that note of inferring: <hi>Therefore the Lorde bleſſed the ſeuenth day &amp; halowed it:</hi>

<pb n="68" facs="tcp:7047:43"/>
conſidered in the Sabbaoth, we may learne, the Lord meant rather to induce vs to the freeneſſe of his goodneſſe in Chriſte in euerie benefite: then to binde vs to any one particular fruit and effect ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the cleareſt teſtimonie of this free goodneſſe we haue in our newe birthe: And yet the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture affirmeth the excellencie of our creation to be in Chriſt, as may appeare by conferring the eighth Pſalme with the 2. chapter to the Hebrues verſe 7.8. and 9:<note place="margin">Pſal. 8.5. Heb. 2.7.8. &amp;. 9.</note> where the excellencie of man aboue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther creatures, is put ouer to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered in Chriſt being crowned with glorie and honour. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet noteth the founteine of all our goodneſſe to be in Chriſt, &amp; the greateſt fruite therof to be our new byrth: notwithſtanding all other benefites are receiued of his children, as fruites and effects there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. And they bound therefore, as in ſanctification, ſo in creation and deliuerance from Aegypt, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowlege the alone &amp; free worke of Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: and this is the cauſe why y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy Ghoſt doth not ſtrictly bind them vnto one benefite in the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruing of the Sabbaoth.</p>
            <p>This commandement teacheth vs mortification: for to that ende are wee taught, that our nature is corrupt, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we may learne to ſubdue the ſame, &amp; to renounce it. The Iewes had this ſpecial ceremonie of reſt, to exerciſe them in the doctrine &amp; practiſe of mortification: the truth of which ceremonie is fulfilled in Chriſte.<note place="margin">Rom. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

with this doctrine, for the Lord hath no ſeruice of vs that he will accept of, if we learne not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce and denie our affections: neither can we goe truely to the obedience of him, but in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall of our ſelues. Our affections are as vntamed coltes that refuſe to draw in the yoke of the Lord: and therefore muſt be tamed if we meane to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terreine obedience. For we can not drawe nere vnto the Lorde, except we ſhall remoue farre, from our ſelues: keeping vnder our wiſedome and affections, that they make no inſurrection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Lorde in the gouernement of his word. If a man might reteine his owne affections and deſires together with the worſhippe of the Lorde, it woulde be receiued of many: but becauſe they can not ſtand together, but he who is ruled by the one muſt depart from the other, the number of them is ſmall, that truely ſerue the Lord. For notwithſtanding there be many that obſerue out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde thinges that apperteine to the profeſſion of religion and outward deedes which they may do, and yet not greatly ſtraine their affections, yet becauſe ſuche men, whenſoeuer the matter of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and duetie directly warreth with their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, then do vſually take part with themſelues in their affections againſte the Lorde, their kinde of ſeruice of the Lord, is but in deede a ſeruing of them ſelues. For they haue not learned this ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall point, without the whiche all the reſt is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. It is a ſmall matter for a man to buſie him ſelfe aboute ſundrie thinges, ſo that he be ſurely
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:7047:44"/>
determined of this, that his affections ſhall no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner be preſſed, but he will forthwith ſet them at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, and let them goe free. If we ſhal haue taken part with the wiſedome of God, to the ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and abandoning of our owne witt, if with his pleaſure, we haue ſtoode againſt our owne, then may we ſay in trueth, that there hath beene ſome religion and ſeruice of God vſed and practiſed of vs, when it hath preuailed to the diſplacing of our owne luſtes and deſires.</p>

               <note place="margin">Free will.</note>By this commandement falleth to the grounde all free will of man to doe good: all workes of preparing vs to receiue Gods grace.

            <p>This commaundement teacheth vs to giue all glorie vnto God, in the true abaſing of our owne corrupt nature: for the Lord is not truely honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and glorified of vs, vnleſſe he be found true, &amp; we liars, he iuſt &amp; we vniuſt.

Yet all this notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, in as much as this ſeue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>th day is appointed by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church for the aſſembling of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faithfull, and for their ioyning together in prayer, Sacramentes, and hearing of the worde, thereby to gette power to ceaſſe from ſinne, (that is our owne wayes and workes,) it cannot without great wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe and ſinne againſt God, be neglected. Wherein the wickedneſſe of this exceedeth, in that men commonly no day in the weeke, followe ſo muche their owne wayes, and the delightes of their owne hart, as on that day, which is appointed to learne them howe to ceaſſe from their owne wayes, workes, and delightes. For a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, (&amp; thoſe not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worſt of all,) take that day to be ordeined only for the eaſe of their bodie, &amp; to be a day of recreation after their trauels &amp; labours that haue beene the ſixe dayes before, and vſe it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly: whereas the Lorde hathe appointed it

to the exerciſe of the word and prayer, that beeing vnburdened of their worldly affaires, they mighte with free harts and mindes attend vpon the word, prayer, and meditation of the mercies &amp; benefites of God, and ſo profit therein, that the other dayes of labour might feele the benefite and commoditie therof, they being better armed to ſtand againſt the occaſions of euil, which men who haue daily dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings in the world, and ſo tickle a diſpoſition vnto ſin, without great grace ſhal neuer be able to auoyd but muſt altogether bee ouerwhelmed therewith.</p>
            <p>And likewiſe it was ordeyned that men by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of his mercies, ſhould ſo be ledd to loue him, and by faith to waite for the mercies and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pynes laide vp for his, that they might become the more willing to ceaſſe from their owne wayes &amp; wills, and to moderate their inordinate deſire after worldly thinges.</p>
            <p>But is this regarded of the moſte, I cannot ſay ſo: for common experience would confute mee. One ſorte (as was declared before) making the caſe of the body to be the end thereof: An other, (a great deale worſe then they) vſing it onely to make good cheere, play and ſporte themſelues on that day.

            <p>In a third ſorte we ſhall ſee it, that if a man haue any matter to deale in, that is of ſmaller importa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce then y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his ordinarie buſines may giue place there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto, thoſe are caſt vpon the Lords day, and then muſte hee and alſo oftentimes ſome of his, be ſent vpon thoſe meſſages or other matters whatſoeuer to diſpatch them.

            <p>In the examination of our ſelues concerning this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement, we haue to learne that we are by nature corrupted in this commaundement as in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reſt, &amp; that there is nothing ſo hard, as with true humilitie of hart to be humbled in acknowledging and mortifying the corruptions, wickednes &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of our nature againſt Gods co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts: in ſomuch that oftentimes he ſuffereth his children to fall into groſſe infirmities, that all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world may ſee it, before they can truly be humbled in the ſight of their infirmitie, and ſo caſt downe as they giue the whole glorie to his mercie, earneſtly ſeting vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their affections for the ſubduing of them. But when it pleaſeth God to pull any out of their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and to begin Chriſtianitie in them, hee doeth let them ſee with aſſurance of his mercie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde them: but ſo, as notwithſtanding he bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them not onely to the ſight and bewailing of that rebellion which they feele in their affections againſt his wil, but alſo to the mortifying and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing thereof.</p>
            <p>The man therefore, that will truely examine him ſelfe, hath to conſider what reſiſting of his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections hath beene in his life, ſo ſhall hee ſoone perceiue, what neede he hath to betake him ſelfe vnto the mediatour CHRISTE IESVS, while
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:7047:47"/>
his conſcience ſhall wittneſſe either of no profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at all herein, or at the leaſt ſo little, as ſhall ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently conuict him, and force him to lay holde vpon the righteouſneſſe of Chriſte, as his only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge: yet ſo, as his care to ſuppreſſe his affections be no leſſe, becauſe hee vnderſtandeth what mercie is in Chriſte, but ſo much the more increaſed, as he perceiueth that trauaile to pleaſe the Lord, euen as the beſt thankfulneſſe that wee can performe, for the great benefite of our redemption.</p>
            <p>Now let vs pray that we may beare ſuch an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimies heart againſt our owne corrupt affections, as may not ſpare to treade vppon them, when ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer they ſhall ryſe vp againſt the Lord.</p>

<pb n="77" facs="tcp:7047:47"/>
happineſſe by him ſelfe alone, hath no neede of our ſeruice: yet will he haue tryall of the loue that wee beare vnto him, not onely by deedes done immediatly vnto him ſelfe, but alſo by deedes done for his cauſe vnto men. He therefore (mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to make a tryall of our loue towardes him) hath commaunded vs that we ſhould not be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether our owne men, cloſed vp within our owne profites and pleaſures, onely regarding and procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them, and wholy taken vp of them, but that we ſhould go out of our ſelues at his commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, to the good of our brethren: witneſſing our thankfulneſſe vnto God, in giuing for his ſake this ſeruice vnto men.</p>
            <p>The dueties vnto GOD (going in order be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe vnto men:) do admoniſh vs of this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, that all our doeings towardes men are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, where Gods glorie doth not go before, as it is written in the Epiſtle of Sainct Iohn:<note place="margin">1. Iohn. 5.2.</note> 
               <hi>In this wee knowe that wee loue the children of GOD, when wee loue God and keepe his commaundementes.</hi> And like as our dealing with men is nothing, when the true ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of God is either not knowen or not regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, ſo that ſeruice that is giuen vnto GOD is not accepted, when our brethren are neglected of vs.<note place="margin">Matth. 5.23. &amp;. 24</note> Therefore doeth our Sauiour Chriſt in Matthew charge vs that when our neighbour hath any thing againſt vs, wee ſhould not preſume to offer any gift vnto God, before we be reconciled, ſo greatly doeth the Lorde eſteeme of this louing conuerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with men, that the holie Ghoſte maketh it

the proofe of our bleſſed eſtate, as it is written in Iohn,<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 3.14.</note> 
               <hi>Wee knowe that we are tranſlated from death to life, becauſe we loue the brethren.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Concerning that which we do owe vnto men: the honourtng of father and mother, hath the firſte place. By Father and mother are all thoſe vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode, who are the inſtruments of GOD in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his ſpeciall goodneſſe towardes vs: whome becauſe hee hath vouchſafed to be his meanes in the conueying of that grace that we doe inioy by them, he cannot abide that they ſhould be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out honour at our handes. By honour (whiche is required to be giuen vnto them) wee are taught ſo to behaue our ſelues towardes them in all our dealinge, as may wittneſſe that in heart wee doe honour them, and therefore this honour doeth not ſo much exact any one ſeuerall thing, as it putteth a qualitie and condition vppon all our behauiour towards them, that it ſhould be ſuch, as it may be a wittneſſe of our hearte howe highlie it doeth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence and regarde them.</p>
            <p>If it be demaunded, why the Lorde by Father and mother, ſhould vnderſtand all the inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of his goodneſſe towards vs, whereas hee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth mention but of one ſorte, it may be required of them againe, why the Lorde forbidding all kinde of violence, ſhould make mention onely of murther: For as by murther beeing the chiefe, he comprehendeth all of that kinde, ſo by one inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his ſpeciall goodneſſe, hee leadeth vs to
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:7047:48"/>
the conſideration of all the like.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, we muſt reuerence the wiſedome of the onely wiſe GOD heerein, who by the moſte groſſe euils, laboureth to worke the loath-thing of all the like, and by benefites and good thinges in them ſelues moſte amiable, to further the cauſe of all the reſt, ſetting the ouglyeſt ſhape he poſſiblie can vppon euils to terrifie vs withall, and giuing to good thinges the countenaunce that may beſt commend them. Our trauaile there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſte bee to ſearche into theſe good thinges which wee receiue by others: that when we ſhall haue founde them, wee may (as by dutie apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyneth) honour the owners of them. Nature may preuaile with them that bee of any conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, for the conceiuing of thoſe benefites whiche they inioye by meanes of theire Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes: ſo that the trauaile neede not to be muche heerein. Reaſon may perſuade, euen the moſte ſimple, that if wee haue any good thinge in this life, or any bleſſing following it, they who haue brought vs into life, may iuſtely clayme a parte therein.</p>
            <p>The matter of Magiſtrates is not ſo plaine, what good wee receiue by them, therefore it cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth more time to be giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto it. The Magiſtrate is the inſtrument of GOD to preſerue that life whiche the Lorde in mercie hath giuen vnto vs. For by the adminiſtration of iuſtice and executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of good lawes, the outrage of the wicked (with
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:7047:49"/>
whome the worlde is alwayes peſtered) is reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from laying violent handes vppon the good, which otherwiſe would at all times burſt foorth, becauſe the occaſion (which is the good workes of the one, and the euill of the other) can neuer bee ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from their liues. And that this is the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 3.12.</note> may be proued out of the Epiſtle of S. Iohn, where, after inquirie had what it was that moued Caine to ſlay Abel, he anſweareth, <hi>Becauſe his owne workes were euill and his brothers good.</hi> And leaſt wee ſhould note ſome extraordinarie thing in Caine, hee putteth all the wicked in the ranke with him, making it the common diſpoſition of them all: and therefore ſaying, We may not bee as Caine which was of the wicked and ſlew his brother.</p>
            <p>It is therefore no ſmall bleſſinge and benefite of God, that keepeth the ſword of the vngodly from our throte, whiche is euery houre drawen out and ſhake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at vs, with whom we can neuer be at league, vnleſſe we will be at one with euill. Moreouer, the bloud which is ſpilt in any land, and the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe that is committed therein, cryeth to the Lord for vengeaunce againſt that land and people wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it is committed, and is ſure to drawe out the ſworde of the Lord againſt that people, if the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate (who is the Lords Lieutenaunt) ſhall not before drawe vppon it, by executing deſerued pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment againſt it.</p>
            <p>Which thinge to be ſo, the very Infidels haue perceiued: and therefore in their greate afflictions haue proceeded by caſting of lottes, to knowe the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:7047:49"/>
malefactour, that by his puniſhmente, the euill might be remoued from them: as wee reade the mariners dealte wih Ionas when the tempeſte was moſte vehement againſt them.<note place="margin">Ionas. 1.7.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore often times in the Scriptures after charge giuen to execute puniſhment againſt ſinne,<note place="margin">Deut. 13.5.</note> theſe or ſuch like wordes are added: <hi>So ſhalt thou take euill away, forth of the middeſt of thee.</hi> And theſe alſo:<note place="margin">Deut. 13.17.</note> 
               <hi>That the Lord may turne from the fierceneſſe of his wrath, and ſhewe thee mercie and haue compaſſion on thee.</hi> Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon charging Benaia (as it appeereth in the booke of kinges) to ſlay Ioab, addeth theſe wordes:<note place="margin">1.

               <hi>That thou mayeſt take away the bloud which Ioab ſhed cauſeleſſe, from me and from the houſe of my Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Magiſtrate therefore as hee keepeth the bloudie hand of the vngodly from vs: ſo is he our ſanctuarie from their ſinne that purſueth vs &amp; our land to deſtroy vs, while he executeth iuſtice vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon it. Miſerable therefore are the Anabapiſtes and ſuche kinde of men, who in denying Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracie, denie thereby thoſe greate comfortes and bleſinges, whiche GOD by them hath graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto his people. The Magiſtrate alſo bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the benefite and helpe of all degrees of men and trades of life vnto vs, ſo that in denying vs their lawfull ayde, wee haue remedie of lawe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, whereby they ſtand bounde to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy them ſelues without deceipt or fraude to our good: whether it bee in place of Iuſtice vnder the Prince &amp; chiefe Magiſtrate, or in any trade or oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupation for the maintenance of them ſelues: while
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:7047:50"/>
we haue ſo many lawes to correct the abuſes in them, that thereby they may bee vſed without guile or deceipt to our moſt profite. But the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt benefite of all other is, when they are y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Gods glorie, in bringing the Goſpell to vs, and maynteining it amongſt vs, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they open the eyes of the ſeers and Prophets, that they be no more ſhut, cauſe the heart of the fooliſh to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand knowledge, and make the tongue of the ſtut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter readie to ſpeake diſtinctlie:<note place="margin">Iſay. 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>.</note> as it is ſpoken of all godlie magiſtrates vnder the perſon of Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chias.</p>
            <p>By which meanes of the Goſpell, euil is diſclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it can no more lurk vnder the name of that it is not, but appearing in his moſte filthie face, may the better be auoyded, and good thinges are brought to their beautie and increaſe, that they may be ſtronger to allure vnto them the heartes of all thoſe that haue any loue of good things with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in them: whiche are in the place aboue named re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited as fruites that followe the receiuing of the Goſpell. By this wee haue ſome taſte of thoſe bleſſings of God, whiche we doe receiue by mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of magiſtrates, how many they bee in number, and how worthie in deſeruing.</p>
            <p>From this ſight, muſte ariſe the true honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of them: for ſo doeth the Apoſtle teache vs to the Romanes: who<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when firſte hee hath taught that the magiſtrate is appointed for the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of the euill and prayſe of the good,<note place="margin">Rom. 13.3.</note> he conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, that therefore wee muſt be ſubiect vnto ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates:
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:7047:50"/>
not onely for feare of their puniſhment, but alſo for conſcience of the good that they doe vnto vs, leaſt (as ſayeth Chryſoſtome vppon thoſe wordes) thou ſhouldeſt bee vnthankfull to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde a benefactour.</p>
            <p>It were too longe to ſtand vpon the benefites that other inferiours receiue from thoſe whome the Lorde hath ſet aboue them: onelie this doe I require of all inferiours, to enter into ſome diligent conſideration thereof: in ſo doeing, I am ſure that they ſhall finde them farre to exceede the opinion that before they had of them.</p>
            <p>It is therefore verye meete and requiſite that our dutie towardes them in all thinges ſhould bee ſuch, as may well bee called a true honouring of them, and a right regarde of ſo greate benefites as we doe receiue by them. The opinion of thoſe men who reſtraine honour onely to ſome ciuil outwarde geſture of the body is ſo friuolous and vaine, as it doth ſcarce deſerue the honour of an aunſwere. That honour is not onely ſeene in ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil geſtures of the bodie, but alſo in outwarde dedes to be done:<note place="margin">1. Tim. 5.17.</note> as may appere in the firſt Epiſtle to Timothie, where the holie Ghoſte (ſpeaking of the mainteynaunce of them that labour in the worde) calleth it <hi>Honour:</hi> affirming that ſuch doe deſerue double honour. And in the ſame Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter he admoniſheth Timothie to honour wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes that haue no kinred to prouide for them, meaning that he ſhould ſe ſo good prouiſion to be made for ſuche, as they mighte take them ſelues
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:7047:51"/>
honoured therein.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 15.</note>And our Sauiour Chriſte reproued the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeies as contemners of the commaundement of God, (commaunding parentes to be honoured) when they gaue counſell to their children to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer vp thoſe thinges in the Temple, whiche ought to haue beene beſtowed towardes the reliefe of their poore parentes. By theſe teſtimonies wee may cleerely ſee, that ſuch things as doe wittneſſe our greate regarde, and louing affections towards others, are iuſtly called by the name of honour, and they truely honoured therein<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>There is a promiſe annexed to this commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, that it ſhall go well with ſuche as honour their ſuperiours, and that their dayes ſhall be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed here vpon earth. The promiſe, in equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is very well aunſwearing to the thing it ſelfe: that thoſe who are thankful to the inſtrumentes of GOD, wherby he hath either begunne, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or any way bleſſed their life, ſhould haue the bleſſing of manye good dayes: and that they who are vnthankfull to thoſe his inſtrumentes of life, ſhould in iuſtice be depriued of the benefite of liuing, beeing ſo vnthankful and vnduetiful to the inſtruments thereof.</p>
            <p>The tranſgreſſion againſt this commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente, threateneth the ſhortening of life vnto the rebellious and diſobedient: whiche puniſhment (if it be not executed againſt his perſon) will not faile to finde out his ſeede and poſteritie, in whom he is ſaid after a manner to liue.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:7047:51"/>Contrarywiſe, obedience to our Parentes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth vs &amp; our poſteritie, according as it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in Ieremie: <hi>Becauſe yee haue obeyed the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Ionadab your father,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iere. 35.18. &amp;. 19.</note> 
               <hi>therefore thus ſayth the Lord of hoſtes the GOD of Iſrael. Ionadab the ſonne of Rechab, ſhall not want a man to ſtand before me for euer.</hi> A greate bleſſing of God to haue a heyre male of our owne ſeed wherein our name may be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued vnto ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny generations. The Verbe that heere is tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated of a Verbe Paſſiue, hath vſually in the Scripture the ſignification of a Verbe Tranſitiue: and therefore thus it may very well be tranſlated: That they (meaning thy Parents) may prolong thy dayes, making the continuaunce of our life, as it were the gifte of Parentes, approuing the honour that their Children giue vnto them: and ſo it is here attributed vnto Ionadab as his bleſſing and benefite, that he ſhall not want a man to ſtand before GOD for euer, notwithſtanding the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience were in his Children. Whereby wee are taught ſo to walke duetifully and thankfully to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes our ſuperiours, as they may be compelled to approue it, and ſo to bleſſe it with many good dayes. For the Lorde to get this honoure of inferiours to their ſuperiours, hath (as it were) put this benefite of longe dayes into their handes, and maketh it to followe their approuing of that thankfulneſſe, whiche they receiue from their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriours.</p>
            <p>This threatening of the Lord, may not onely
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:7047:52"/>
bring a terrour vnto rebellious ſubiectes, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient children, whiche liue in the diſpleaſure of their ſuperiours, iuſtly conceiued againſt them: but alſo vnto thoſe (who notwithſtanding they haue committed nothing that iuſtly may diſpleaſe them) yet haue not done any thing that may iuſtly chalenge approbation and lyking from them. This curſe (of cutting off the length of their liues, either in their owne perſon, or in their poſteritie) moſte iuſtly falleth vpon ſuch, as greatly regarde not the conſent of their parentes in that weightie matter of marriage. Parentes haue heere to learne the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vp of their children in all obedience and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence towards them ſelues, leſt by their too much lenitie, they bring ſuch an infection into their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, as will not departe from them, before it hath broughte them all vnto the graue, that there bee not one man of their ſeede lefte to continue their name.</p>
            <p>This bleſſing (of many good dayes promiſed to obedient inferiours) is ſo farr foorth perfourmed, as it may be a bleſſing vnto them. For ſometime God in mercie taketh away obedient children in their young yeeres, that they ſhould not taſte of the afflictions that he meaneth to bring vpon the land: or leſt the iniquities of thoſe dayes ſhould peruert them.<note place="margin">Deut. 5.16.</note> In Deuteronomie vnto the promiſe of long life are added theſe wordes, <hi>That it may be well with thee,</hi> promiſing them benefite of longe life no longer, then it ſhall be for their weale to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:7047:52"/>So likewiſe it may come to paſſe, that a diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient childe may liue long, to taſte of the griefe of diſobedience in his owne Children, to ſuffer exile and baniſhment, or ſome one greate puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or other: or elſe that his wickedneſſe may growe yet riper to reuengement, ſo that it be no longer a bleſſing to inioy ſuch dayes. Wee muſt remember that all this which hath beene ſpoken of obedience, and the bleſſing thereof, muſt be limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſo, as in obeying them we do not diſobey God, and go contrarie vnto his word.</p>
            <p>This commaundemente alſo bindeth ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours vnto their inferiours. For thoſe gifes of God that come with ſpeciall direction to be employed vnto certein perſons, (as do the gifts of inferiours) cannot in equitie, but haue ſome ſpeciall conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from them againe, vppon whome they are thus eſpecially employed. Heerevpon aryſeth the particular callings that bee, when by reaſon of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular benefites and bleſſinges whiche wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue of particular perſons, wee become indebted vnto them againe for ſeuerall dueties, more and aboue thoſe generall dueties which we owe vnto all men.</p>
            <p>This commaundement comprehendeth all parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular callings of what co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition ſoeuer they ſhalbe. For the lawe beeing a perfecte rule of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, cannot content it ſelfe with generall duties alone. When this duetie from ſuperiours is not giuen to them that be vnder them, it commeth of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to paſſe by the iuſt iudgement of God (and yet
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:7047:53"/>
with the inferiours their great ſinne &amp; heynous of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,) that they become vnthankeful, vndutiful &amp; rebellious againſte thoſe that be ſet ouer them, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the iuſt iudgement of God to denie duetie vnto them, from whom they haue receiued none. Maiſters complaine of the vnfaithfulneſſe of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, and yet was there neuer any time when ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunts had iuſter cauſe to complaine of vndutifull maiſters. For where are thoſe maſters to be found that haue any iuſt regard of the ſwette of their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, (which is their bloud) beſtowed in their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice? How ſlenderly are they recompenced, when they haue ſpent their young yeares, (the flower of their life) vpon them? yet euen reaſon would, that ſeeing the Lorde hathe laide the maintenance of their life vpon their labour and trauell which their maiſters haue eaten vp, they ſhould not be ſo cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly vnkinde, as after their long ſeruice to ſende them away with an emptie hand. I omit to ſpeake how litle y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> care is of bringing them vp in the feare of God. The number of thoſe parentes which care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully perfourme this dutie towards their children, to make them learned in the lawe of their God is as ſmall. And where ſhall we finde any number of ſuche Magiſtrates, as employ them ſelues to terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie wickedneſſe and wicked men, and to incourage the good in their goodneſſe? Theſe thinges are as wel due from them, as the other duties before reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted belong vnto them.</p>

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:7047:53"/>
which may witnes y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they are not vnthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for thoſe ſpecial benefits which they do receiue from them. For if loue (whiche hathe in it ſpeciall good will and liking) be commanded towardes all men in generall, there muſt of neceſsitie be a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter meaſure of it betwene thoſe, that are more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly employed the one vpon the other. This louing regard of them outwardly declared in deed and behauiour, muſt come in as a ſupplie to helpe to beare and ſuſteine the weight of labour &amp; ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection, whiche the nature of man otherwiſe can hardly digeſt, as in a mans bodie more labour or coſt is beſtowed about thoſe parts that haue the leſt beautie and forme in themſelues, in ſo muche that thoſe parts, which (as they are of themſelues) dare leaſt abide the eye, are ſet forth with more beautie to the eye, thereby (after a manner) hauing recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of their want in the bodie, ſo in the bodie of the common wealth, and in the ſocietie of man, tender regarde of ſuperiours and amiable affection towards thoſe that be vnder them, ſhould beare vp a part of that heauie burthen of ſubiection and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice.</p>
            <p>The gyftes and graces of God in others craue alſo honour from vs. For being fellowe-members of one bodie, we haue our benefite, and fare the better for the ſeuerall gyftes of others. For the Lorde hathe made ſuche a diuiſion of his gyftes, as that he hath laide a neceſſarie part of the welfare of euerie man out of himſelfe in ſome other: the lack wherof, maketh him maymed in him ſelfe, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:7047:54"/>
forceth him to ſeeke vnto others, for his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecte forme &amp; iuſt proportion. Theſe gyfts of God wee are not only bound to ſee and behold, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to ſubiect our ſelues in modeſtie vnto them, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen he that hath more vnto him that hath leſſe, as it is written to the Philippians: <hi>In meekeneſſe of minde let euerie man eſteeme another better then himſelfe.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Philip 2.3.</note> And to the Romanes, <hi>In giuing of honour, let one go before another.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 10.12</note> There is as great a cauſe why the aged ſhuld be honoured in his knowledge long time experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced in good thinges, as the young man for the ripeneſſe of his witte: and therefore men muſt mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually reuerence the gyfts of their fellow brethren, if loue and liking ſhall be any longe time mutual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie vpholden. That is the cauſe, why in the ſame verſe when the Apoſtle had perſuaded vs to bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly loue, immediately hath theſe wordes: <hi>In gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of honour, go one before another:</hi> as if the one would not long continue, where there were not the other. There is no one thing that our nature can leſſe like of, then to be vnder contempt, and that nothing ſhould be eſpied in vs for the whiche men woulde regarde vs: wherefore it ſtandeth all vpon, to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell ſo in finding out the goodneſſe of the gyftes and graces of GOD in other, as their hartes may in vnfeignedneſſe yelde reuerence therevnto: and alſo thereby to make a defence againſt infirmities whiche wilbe in fleſh and bloud, that there may be bearing and forbearing one of another, by loue &amp; reuerent regarde had to the gyftes of Gods grace in

them.</p>
            <p>Our nature is no better inclined in dueties towardes men, then it is (as before we haue lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned) in dueties towardes God. For we are giuen to ſeeke to haue our ſelues honoured in our calling or gyft whatſoeuer, but litle to regard, nay euen to enuie the honour of others: whiche we ſhall then diſcerne, when any ſhalbe compared with vs, and made either ſuperiours, or elſe equals vnto vs. And therefore when it pleaſeth God to call any of his vnto the hope of his kingdome, he letteth them ſee their corruption euen in this commandement, ſo as they are forced by the ſenſe and feeling thereof to giue ouer the claime of ſaluation in the title of their workes, whiche haue no promiſe if they doe not perfourme the whole lawe and euerie worke thereof throughout the whole courſe of their life. For it is written in Deuteronomie,<note place="margin">Deut. 27.16.</note> Curſed is hee that confirmeth not all the wordes of this lawe to do them. And I would willingly learne what man there is y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> can truely ſay, that he hath neither done nor yet left vndone any thing, either to his ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our or inferiour to men of greater gyfts or leſſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him ſelfe, which did bewray want of honouring of them from his hart. The lord alſo cauſeth thoſe whom he calleth, both carefully to ſtand in watch againſt their infirmitie, leſt it ſhould burſte forthe to the diſhonour of God, &amp; likewiſe more hartily to require a readie and willing affection to procure the honour of his name, by walking duetifully in this commandement.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:7047:55"/>And if the outward work of this commaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſhould be attended vpon of any neuer ſo diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, &amp; yet Gods glorie not ſought therein, it would profite vs nothing. For if we giue men their due, and in the meane time deny the Lorde his, what auayleth it vs? Therefore thoſe former foure pointes (wherein his glorie conſiſteth) conteyned in the former commaundements, muſt of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie be ioyned with all duties vnto men, which are: Firſt y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we acknowledging all our welfare to come from the Lorde alone, doe depend wholy and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vpon him. Secondly, that in loue of him for his mercyes wee begin to obey him after his word. Thirdly that his glorie beeing the marke we ſhoot at, make vs carefull in all our works, ſo to do them as he may haue honour by them. Fourthly, and laſt of all, that in true acknowledging and trauaile in ſubduing of our owne corruptions (whiche will not altogether bee ſundred from our wayes and workes) we humble our ſelues in our beſt obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that the Lord may alwayes reteine the praiſe of the free and vndeſerued working of his grace.</p>
            <p>Now let vs pray vnto our heauenly father, that we may truely ſee and bewaile the little reuerence and regarde that we haue had bothe to ſuperiours and inferiours, becomming thereby not onely vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfull vnto them, but alſo vnto the Lord, who hath placed ſuch graces for our benefite in them: and let vs craue of him, that we may not onely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine more power to ſuppreſſe the ſame, but alſo may be inabled from him to ſend abroade ſuche

Our neighbour therefore in this conſideration is not ſhut vp in the alone fleſhe &amp; bloud of the man, but the duties of neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hode reache vnto the life and bodie, wife, goodes, and good name of the man.

This puniſhment doth not only declare the vnlawfulneſſe of violence whiche here is forbiden, but alſo by that puniſhment whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che the iuſt Lord did appoint for it, we ſee howe great the offence is which hath had ſuche a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment appointed for it from the iuſtice of God, that more account may be made of ſuche iniuries, then commonly there is in any place. In this comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement is forbidden all crueltie: and therfore in the puniſhment of certeine offences, there was a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſtripes appointed, whiche in puniſhing they might not paſſe: as we reade in Deut.<note place="margin">Deut. 25.2.3</note> So doeth the Lorde abhorre crueltie, that he would not haue it couered, no not vnder the cloake of iuſtice &amp; zeale againſt ſinne, whiche vnder that pretence might be ſhadowed, if in any reſpect at al it were to be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned.

For what man al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt is there of any worſhippe or wealth, who thinketh not that he may lawfully vſe his tenaunt, or poore neighbour without any wages? yet the prophet Ieremie pronounceth woe againſte this kinde of crueltie in theſe wordes:<note place="margin">Iere. 22.13.</note>

If ſuche buildinges ſtande vpon vnrighteouſneſſe, (as ſayth the prophete,) it is to be feared that many a faire houſe in this land hathe ſuche a ruinous foundation, as threateneth the deſtruction of the owner.

Theſe examples that nowe I haue alledged, as they ſpring from an vnmercifull heart, and tende to the vniuſt griefe and moleſtation of the bodie and life of our brother, ſo are they directly againſte this commandement.

            <p>The negligence of man, whereby his neighbour receiueth either loſſe of life, or hurt of bodie, is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden in this commandement. The reaſon is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie good. For if the Lord hathe lawfully and in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie laide vpon vs the care of our neighbour his life, by good right may he require at our handes the wilfull neglecte thereof. The puniſhment of ſuche wilfull negligence towardes the life or bodie of their brethren, was moſte ſharpe and ſeuere in the olde lawe, as we may ſee in Exodus,<note place="margin">Exod. 21.28</note> where the mans owne life muſt anſwere for the life of his brother who periſhed by his negligence: ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the example is ſett downe there, of a man not keeping vppe his oxe whiche he knewe was woonte to puſhe.

            <p>In this offence of negligence are all thoſe tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſours againſt this commaundement, who by. delaying to take vppe matters in controuerſie or ſuites of lawe with all poſſible ſpeede that may be, doe by their negligence giue occaſion to the fraile nature of man to committe murder or ſome other miſchiefe, againſt him with whome he is in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie. And if careleſſe negligence be thus daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, howe harde a matter will it be to reckon with the Lorde for deliberate purpoſe to kepe men at variance and debate, that their gaine may grow thereby? It wilbe a harde matter to anſwere be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Almightie, if wee haue giuen occaſion whereby our neighbour hathe receiued loſſe of life. Dauids carefulneſſe herein is woorthily commended to all poſteritie, who when his men (breaking through the hoaſt of the Philiſtins with the daunger of their liues) had brought him water to drinke whiche he ſo greatly thirſted after and wiſhed for, immediately powred it out for an oblation vnto the Lorde, and ſaide, <hi>Let not my God ſuffer me to doe this:</hi>

               <hi>That whoſoeuer hateth his brother is a manſlear.</hi> We ſee then that not onely groſſe euils come into reckoning before the Lord, but euen hatred ſettled in the heart, although the hand hath neuer beene ſtretched foorth to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute the ſame, neither commeth it before him as ſome trifling thing whiche doeth not greatly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe him, but appeareth monſtrous, hauing none other ſhape vpon it, nor other accounte made of it then of murder.

And bycauſe wordes bewray y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which lurketh in the heart, and bringeth it to light that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe would not ſo eaſily be eſpied, we muſt keepe ſome good watche ouer them, that from thence we may be ledde to the priuie chamber of the heart, to ſee how al thinges go there: for of the aboundance of the heart the mouthe ſpeaketh, ſo that there is no outward thing, that can bring vs ſooner to the ſight and ſpeeche of the heart, then can the tongue it ſelfe: whiche if it bee infected with hatred or diſdaine, ſure it is that all thinges are not well at home in the heart: and therefore all men muſt obſerue the inclination of the heart by the vſage of the tongue, that when it commeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broade caſting forth hatred, wrath, and debate, we may with ſpeede returne to the founteine, that is the heart, to purge and cleanſe the ſame: becauſe we are ſure, that from thence the tongue receiueth all
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:7047:60"/>
poyſon. If we ſhall preuaile muche in ſuppreſſing hatred both in our heart, tongue, and hand, yet is not that all whiche is here commanded. For the Lorde in forbidding murder, meant not to ſtay there, but in remouing hatred, his purpoſe was to make way &amp; paſſage for merciful dealing towards the life of others. And neceſſarie it was y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſhould giue vs warning of that ſtumbling blocke whiche lieth in the way, leſt we ſuſpecting no ſuch matter, ſhould haue imagined that there would haue bene true care for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> life of our brother, where there was no victorie before ouer our own diſpoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which is altogether otherwiſe giuen &amp; inclined. The true profe wherof we ſhal then haue, when our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſhalbe ſtired vp by any dealing which ſhal miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like vs. For then we ſhal well perceiue wrath to be mightily working in vs, which before (becauſe it had peraduenture no great matter to worke vpon) we thought that we had bene altogether voide of, or at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> leſt not greatly infected therwith. But now in this manner of ſpeaking vſed by the holy Ghoſt (who battereth downe hatred, when his purpoſe is to builde vp loue) we ſee y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there will be no paſſage to any louing dealing in trueth, but by treading down of our contrarie affections, which are noted to bee in vs by the fourme of ſpeaking. For to what ende ſhould the holy Ghoſte will vs to doe no murder, if there were no diſpoſition in vs thervnto? This is the cauſe why y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy Ghoſt dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth ſo plainely with vs, in telling vs what we are, that our care may be great to reforme it. And when we ſhal haue profited any thing herein, it may be
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:7047:61"/>
acknowledged from whence we had that, whiche we are aſſured was not to be founde in our nature. The holy Ghoſt therefore in this place detecteth our nature of want of loue, nay, of hatred &amp; cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, whiche otherwiſe we ſhould not haue marked no nor ſuſpected our ſelues of it, if we had not had warning from the almightie that our nature is poyſoned therewithall. For if a man (not fearing God, yet otherwiſe of good vnderſtanding to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the trueth of things) be demaunded what his opinion is of himſelf, whether he be prone &amp; bent to hatred, &amp; whether he findeth his nature greatly inclining thereto or no, he will with great proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation conſtantly affirme, that in him (he thanketh God) there is no ſuche matter: abiuring it, with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration and woondring how any man ſhould be brought to think ſo of him: &amp; thus in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> not vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his owne corruption, he ſeeth not what neede he hath of a ſauiour &amp; redeemer, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whatſoeuer hee ſayeth, is in deede and trueth vnthanckfull for that benefite, while in finding no great thing amiſſe in himſelfe, he cannot ſee what way he ſhould ſo greatly be beholding to a ſauiour that would anſwer for his tranſgreſsions, which in his owne opinion is no greate matter to doe, they being either fewe, and ſo borne out in the number of thoſe good thinges which he hathe done, or elſe none at all. Moreouer, if wee ſhall haue done ſomething, or diuerſe thinges that may be thought louing and friendly, yet if the inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to wrath (which is by nature in vs) be either
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:7047:61"/>
not knowen, or being knowen, the ſtrength there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſhall not bee ſubdued, and the ſting pulled out that it reigne no more within vs, we ſhall neuer be prouoked by any euill dealing of others, but that foorthwith (letting the reyne go to our heart) we ſhall diſhonour his name in following the rage of our minde contrarie to the lawe of our God. So might it come to paſſe that a man (hauing ſome good opinion of him ſelfe, for ſome outwarde things, but neuer tryed with iniurious dealing of another) might take it to go well with him, when notwithſtanding this corrupt nature of his ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth whole in her full force and ſtrength, beeing neuer a whit ſubdued vnto the ſpirite, as hee well perceiueth when that any great occaſion ſhal be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to try him with all. We ſee then how iuſt cauſe there is, that the Lord ſhould admoniſh vs of this corruption of hatred which is within vs: not onely that we ſhould ſee the benefite of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our and mediatour, but alſo that ſubduing it and treading downe the ſtrength of it, we might finde free paſſage, to doe and not to be remoued from doeing the workes of mercie and loue whiche are heere co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded, euen the contrarie of thoſe that (as we haue heard) were forbidden vs. We are commaunded to haue care of the body and life of our brother, to mainteine it as his neceſſitie ſhal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, and our abilitie can perfourme, remembring that the Lord hath commited that care vnto vs.</p>
            <p>The Iewes were commanded to make places of refuge and defence,<note place="margin">Deut. 4.</note> where the guiltleſſe perſons
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:7047:62"/>
might haue protection againſt the rage of them who purſued them vnto death: that (as it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in Deuter.<note place="margin">Deut. 19.10</note>) innocent bloud be not ſhedd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their land, and leaſt bloud ſhould be vpon them: (for theſe are the very wordes of the texte in that place) ſignifying that the not regarding and proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for the ſafetie of their life were matter ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient inough to make them &amp; their land guiltie of their bloud, that thereby they might well vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that the care of their brethrens life was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended vnto them, not without greate danger, if there were to be found any negligence therein.</p>
            <p>Mercifull dealing is heere commaunded to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes all, but eſpecially towards inferiours, wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, fatherleſſe children, and thoſe that be in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny greate extremitie. A notable practiſe we haue of this in the perſon of Iob ſuffering his ſeruauntes to pleade their right,<note place="margin">Iob. 31.13.</note> and to maynteine their good cauſe before him: not vſing his authoritie to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe them, and crueltie to execute his rage, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out regarding the equitie of their cauſe, only ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vpon his owne authoritie ouer them: <hi>If I did contemne the iudgement of my ſeruaunt, and of my maide,</hi> (ſayeth Iob) <hi>when they did contend with me, what then ſhall I doe when GOD ſtandeth vp? and when hee ſhall viſite me, what ſhall I anſwere? he that hath made me in the wombe hath he not made him?</hi> Here is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true tryall of a mercifull man: for it is no commendation, not to offer wrong vnto thoſe who are our equals and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to match vs, but then haue we true tryall of our affections that there is ſome mercie in trueth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:7047:62"/>
vs, when we ſhall ſhewe pittie and compaſſion towardes, thoſe whome (for our authoritie or place that we bee in) wee might eaſily oppreſſe: when we ſhalbe kept from fleſhing our affections vpon thoſe that lay open vnto vs, hauing no fence of power or credite, that is ſufficiently able to holde vs. His example of compaſſion is no leſſe commendable towardes all of them that were in any greate want or extremitie, as the holie Ghoſte (vnder his perſon) witneſſeth in theſe wordes:<note place="margin">Iob. 29.12.</note> 
               <hi>I deliuered the poore that cryed, and the fatherleſſe: and him that had none to help him. The bleſſing of him that was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to periſh came vpon me, and I cauſed the widowes heart to reioyce.</hi> The Iewes were bound to declare their compaſſion towardes their brethren, by that lawe which commaunded them to lend their brother that was needie amongſt them, ſufficient for his neede: taking for aſſurance, a pledge whiche hee might forbeare, as appeareth in Deuteronomie:<note place="margin">Deut. 15.8.</note> where they haue a ſtreight charge, that when the yeere of <hi>Iubilie</hi> ſhould approche (at what time all men were charged to releſe their debts) they ſhould not at that time ſhut vp their compaſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from him that would borrowe for his nede, but frankly giue vnto him notwithſtanding y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> yeere when all debts muſt be releaſed be euen at hand. There is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe added to incourage them, that for ſo doeing the Lord would bleſſe them in all that they ſhould put their hand vnto.</p>
            <p>They were charged alſo to relieue their brother or the ſtraunger that dwelte with them, who
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:7047:63"/>
was fallen into decay, forbidding them in expreſſe wordes to take any vſurie or increaſe of ſuche, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of money or meate,<note place="margin">Leuit. 25.35.36.</note> as appeareth in Leuiticus: vſing their goodes to ſuche comforte of their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, as might wel witneſſe the loue that they had vnto them. The lawe and commaundement that was giuen to this people at the time when they had made an end of the tything of their increaſe, doth declare that they had in charge fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Lord, to relieue with their goodes, the Leuite, ſtraunger, fatherleſſe and widowe.<note place="margin">Deu. 26.13.</note> For in Deuter. before the people ſhould craue of God that hee would bleſſe their land, they muſt proteſt in ſet words that they had giuen vnto the Leuites, ſtraunger, fatherleſſe, and widowe, accordingly as he had commaunded them, and ſo proceede after declaration of this their obedience to his will, to craue his bleſſing for the people and the lande: thus vſing their goods to the commoditie of their brethren, in lending and giuing according to Gods appointment, they did giue apparaunt tokens of loue towardes their neighbours. The Apoſtle Paule will not acquite him that hath ſtolne if he ſhall ſteale no more, but chargeth him that he ſhall labour that he may haue ſome thing to giue to him that needeth, that way to practiſe loue and the workes thereof vppon his needy brethren. It is not onely therefore the dutie of rich-men to giue ſomething towarde the reliefe of the needy, but euen the poore muſt ſpare ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of their pouertie to the comfort of Chriſt in his needie members: which be it neuer ſo litle that
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:7047:63"/>
they offered of their pouertie (if there go a willing and a faithfull minde withall) is much more accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to God, then great ſummes giuen from ſome wealthie men of their ſuperfluitie onely, without like faith or loue vnto the Lord: as wee are taught in the parable of the widowe caſting in her two mites into the treaſurie, which are iuſtified by our ſauiour Chriſte to be more then all that the riche had caſt in, becauſe theirs was of their ſuperfluitie,<note place="margin">Mat. 12.43.</note> but hers of her pouertie. If any ought to be diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed withall from declaring their loue in this parte, it is very reaſonable that he (who by reaſon of his long loitering in acquainta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce with ſtealing &amp; idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes was become through cuſtome whiche is an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nature, vnapt for labour) ſhould be diſcharged vpon the maintenance of him ſelfe by ſome ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt trade: yet notwithſtanding, euen hee ſtandeth charged from the Lorde, to reſerue ſome thing for the prouiſion of his needie members.</p>
            <p>To encourage vs to duetie in this part of merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full dealing and giuing to the needie, the Lorde doeth promiſe that it ſhall bee paide vs againe in our greateſt need. For thus ſaith the Prophet Iſay, <hi>If thou refreſh the hungry and troubled ſoule,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſay. 58.10.</note> 
               <hi>then ſhall thy light ſpring out in darkneſſe.

            <p>Who would not be content to giue, if he might be ſure to haue it againe at his moſte neede? And beholde we haue letters patents from the Lorde, vnder the broade ſeale of his bloude, for the finde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that wee haue laide out for him, euen in our greateſt neede. How can we then be ſlack in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall laying out of ſome thing for an euil day? ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the counſell of the holie Ghoſte in Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtes:<note place="margin">Eccle. 11.2.</note>

            <p>Moreouer, the ſentence of that great day procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth againſt the damned perſons in this fourme. <hi>Departe from me ye curſed into euerlaſting fire whiche is prepared for the diuel and his angels: for I was an hungred, and ye gaue me no meate:</hi>

We learned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that negligent delaying, whereby our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boure is indaungered in his body or life, was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden in this commaundement: and then is ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy helpe and diligent vſing of the preſent occaſion that is offered to doe our neighbour good giuen vs heere in commaundement.

            <p>Our naturall inclination goeth wholy amiſſe in this commaundement as in the reſt: which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding it lye hid in ſome more cloaſely then in other, for all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> it is not ſo cunningly couered in a ny, but that it is diſcloſed and diſcerned when oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion is offered. The man that is borne again vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hope of euerlaſting life, doth ſo cleerely perceiue his infectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heerin, that both in hart &amp; word he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth the great neceſſitie &amp; benefite of a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour &amp; redemer: being priuy vnto himſelf not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of many euil fruts y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> haue appeared in his life co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to this commaundement, but alſo of a diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition within, that is naturally prone &amp; inclined to offend heerein. The hope that he hath in his medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atour and ſauiour Chriſt Ieſus, doth not make him ſecure and careleſſe in his ſinne, following the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of his owne heart, but leadeth him to a continuall ſtrife and debate with it, becauſe it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> honour of his God and ſauiour, to whom he well perceiueth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he is onely beholding for his ſaluation, and quickeneth him to all louing dealing which is ſo often commended and commaunded of his good and mercifull father.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:7047:65"/>The naturall man ſeeth not any ſuch inclination in him ſelfe to wrath, or dulneſſe vnto louing dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with his neighbours, as through the grief ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with driueth him to make much of the alone Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour and redeemer Chriſte, but when he is char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with his offences that burſt foorth contrary to this commaundement, hee maketh light of them, and putteth them vp in a common bagge, ſaying, all men haue infirmities: neuer ſo touched with it, as hee can bee compelled to magnifie the grace brought by the alone mediatour Chriſt, and much leſſe is he driuen to any earneſt warre with it, or great care to profite in the works of loue, that are contrarie to it.</p>
            <p>To conclude, this commaundement if wee ſhall doe ſome outwarde thinges commaunded heere whiche ſhall obteine greate commendation of many men, and for all that the Lorde want his glorie, which conſiſteth in the foure points which were ſpoken of in the former commaundement, it ſhall auayle vs nothing. Thoſe things that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perteine vnto God, muſt of neceſſitie go with thoſe dueties vnto men that ſhall be accepted. Neither in deede can we holde out in theſe, except we haue life and incouragement from the other. For the loue that GOD is our God, tenderly fauouring and plentifully rewarding vs that bee his, muſte make vs to perſeuere in thoſe dueties which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe would not abide the reproches and iniuries of men, but would burſt foorth to requite them: and muche leſſe would wee laboure to ouercome
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:7047:65"/>
them and their euill, with our good doone vnto them. But this perſuaſion of his good fauour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes his, and plentifull mercie whiche is to bee ſhewed vpon them, maketh men willingly to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare the inſuing and ſatiſfying of their owne cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt affections, not enuying the wicked their tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitorie delights, but proſecuting their courſe in his obedience, through all their reproches, while they doe well perceiue what a plentifull recompence of rewarde abideth for them by the free gifte of their GOD.</p>
            <p>The man that cannot be perſuaded but that hee loueth his neighbour as himſelfe, perfourming all that is required of him in that behalfe, muſt be ſent to examine him ſelfe, if there haue at no time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in him any cruell dealing, towarde his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriours, any neglect or delay in helping and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing the diſtreſſed, if compaſſion hath alwayes, as occaſion ſerued, drawen him to ſpeedie relee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, by lending or giuing, ſo ſhall he eaſily ſee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the errour of his opinion.</p>
            <p>Now let vs pray vnto our heauenlie Father, that we may ſo ſee into our cruell and careleſſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, that we may magnifie the free mercies of our GOD in the forgiueneſſe thereof: and alſo haue power more and more to ſubdue it, that wee abounding in all mercifull dealing, may glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie him in this life, and be glorified of him in the life to come.</p>

For the excuſe is vaine and childiſh to ſay we loue the man, when we ſtick not there to vexe him, where we knowe it cannot be but that ſome greate griefe of heart will come vnto him.</p>
            <p>He that loueth a man in deede, dealeth ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly with all thoſe thinges that are eſpecially li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked of that man: fearing moſte of all there to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, where he vnderſtandeth that he may the ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt diſpleaſe. And becauſe nexte to a man him ſelfe, his wife ought to be moſt deere vnto him, the wrong that is done to any therein, cannot but haue the next place vnto the ſinne of murder.</p>
            <p>The greatneſſe of this ſinne of whordome ſhall then better be diſcerned, when wee ſhall bring our
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:7047:66"/>
minde from that account which is made of it with man, vnto that iudgement whiche the moſte iuſte GOD hath ſet downe of it in his worde.</p>
            <p>It hath beene obſerued in all times, and is to be ſeene at large in the olde Teſtament, that the ſinne of adulterie and vncleanneſſe hath then abounded moſte, when for their idolatrie the people hath beene vnder the greateſt diſpleaſure of the Lorde.<note place="margin">Rom. 1.24.26.27.</note> And if to be giuen vp to this &amp; ſuch like kindes of vncleaneſſe hath bene the puniſhment of that moſt greeuous ſinne of idolatrie, we may ſoone coniec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in what account it ſtandeth before the Lorde. For it cannot be holden for a ſmall offence before him, which he in iuſtice taketh to be a due puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the greateſt ſinne.</p>
            <p>The holie Ghoſte maketh the crime of theft, a ſmall matter in reſpect of the offence of adulterie: affirming theft to be ſubiect neither to the like in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famie and reproche with men, neither yet to the like greeuouſneſſe of puniſhment from the Lord. And therfore when he hath ſpoken of the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that is due for theft, amplifying the other crime aboue it, hee vſeth theſe wordes: <hi>But hee that committeth adulterie with a woman,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pro. 6.32.</note> 
               <hi>hee is deſtitute of vnderſtanding: hee that doeth it, deſtroyeth his owne ſoule, hee ſhall finde a wounde and diſhonour, and his reproche ſhall neuer bee put away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus the adulterer in his wickedneſſe doth both vndermine his owne life, and alſo bringeth ſuche a blot of infamie and reproche vnto his name, as

There is great cauſe therefore why the holy Ghoſt ſhoulde ſo earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſuade vs to flie fornication, making y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſinne aboue all other to offend againſte his owne bodie whiche doth committe it.</p>
            <p>Neither are theſe two eſpeciall braunches of

            <p>The meanes alſo whiche bring them on, and do begett them, or being begotten doe cherriſh and mainteine them, are here forbidden in this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement: as, the want of temperaunce and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brietie in apparell, meate, and drinke, idleneſſe, euil companie, euil ſpeche, and filthie communication: in the which, whiles we doe cherriſhe our ſelues, not bridling our affections, we do tempt the Lord, and running vppon the rockes that he hath forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, doe hazarde our chaſte behauiour. For we haue no warrant of his ſafe conducting of vs vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thoſe ſayles of vncleanneſſe, but threatening, that in ſo dooing we ſhall make ſhipwracke of all honeſt and chaſt behauiour. For to walke in ſuch wayes, hathe no promiſe of protection from him: they are not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wayes which he hath promiſed to proſper.

For theſe thinges before recited and ſuche like, are we forewarned of in the Scriptures to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of, as thoſe thinges that lie in waite to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue vs, and lay ſiege vnto our good conuerſation to giue it an ouerthrowe. Neither is the aſſault ſo weake (as we ſuppoſe commonly) that it neede not to be feared, but ſo ſtrong as beeing continued,

            <p>This foreſpeeche (I ſay) pointeth out the tickle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of our corrupte nature, and is vſed of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle elſewhere, after he hathe giuen admonition to the faithful, for auoyding of the like matters, as filthineſſe, fooliſhe talking and ieſting, conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with theſe wordes:<note place="margin">Epheſ. 5.6.</note>

Can we nowe continue without feare of theſe enimies, when the holy Ghoſt hath deſcried the daunger of them, with ſo many blaſtes of his owne trumpet? or dare we ſay there will followe no harme, when the holy Ghoſt ſaith in plaine words, that it doeth corrupt good manners, and that for ſuche thinges, the wrath of God commeth vppon the children of diſobedience? And euen in this commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we ſee, that the holy Ghoſte doth vouche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe them none other name, then the name of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulterie.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:7047:71"/>For ſure it is, that vnder this word they are forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by the teſtimonie of all the learned: therefore it is well to be conſidered howe the holy Ghoſte doth terme it, and his reaſon whie he will haue it knowne by that name. Sure it is, that he is well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with our nature, which is accuſtomed to make ſmall accompt of great euils, and therefore to giue them names accordingly, he is conſtrained to name the childe himſelfe, and cal it adulterie: wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling vs ſo to take it, and to thinke no better of it, whenſoeuer we ſhall let the reyne goe to our affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, not reſtraining them in theſe and ſuche like thinges. The Prophet Ezechiel ſaieth in expreſſe wordes,<note place="margin">Eze. 16.49.</note> that pride, fulneſſe of bread, and aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of idleneſſe were the ſinnes of Sodome, that brought downe fire &amp; brimſtone fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heauen vpon them. Thus the holy Ghoſt writeth the meanes of vncleannes and filthineſſe, &amp; blameth them for al that puniſhment, that followed their abhominable vncleanneſſe, and filthineſſe, not to be named: tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching vs thereby, that we may not mainteine this exceſſiue eating and drinking, proude and wanton attyreing of our ſelues, and ſurfetting, vnder the name of good fellowſhippe, ciuil behauiour, and ſuche like titles, but that we knowe them by the names whiche the holy Ghoſte hathe giuen vnto them, who knoweth better then we what they are, and therefore hathe giuen them their names accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.</p>
            <p>Our nature (if wee knewe it as the trueth
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:7047:71"/>
is) needeth not to be made tame vnto ſathan by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch meanes. We are of our ſelues inclined too much to imbrace him, and nothing ſo wylde that way as were to be wiſhed. Being therefore ſo ouertractable of our ſelues, what madneſſe is it to offer him thoſe blockes of aduauntage, wherby his temptations with more ſpede &amp; eaſe may mount vpon vs, and thus willingly to holde the ſtirrup to our owne deſtruction? The heart of man (beeing the founteine from whence commeth good or badde) may not be ſuffered to goe at libertie after vnchaſte thoughtes, but muſt be kept in, with the feare of God. For out of the heart of man (as ſayth our ſauiour Chriſt,) <hi>proceede euil thoughtes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Marke. 7.21</note> 
               <hi>adulteries, fornication, vncleanneſſe, a wicked eye.</hi> All theſe euils come from within, and defile a man. They are not therfore to be cherriſhed and followed after, but to be repreſſed and beaten backe, of ſo many as feare y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lorde.</p>
            <p>The daunger is not only of the ſoule in time to come, but as experience telleth vs, in cherriſhing of vncleane thoughtes, there is perill towardes the reaſon and witte of man. For howe often falleth it out, that men by giuing themſelues ouer vnto theſe thoughtes, become madde, voyde of witte, &amp; reaſon, not able to gouerne them ſelues like other men? And therefore hathe that vertue whiche re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth theſe affections, a name with the Graecians which carrieth with it y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſignification of that fruite and effecte whiche doeth followe it: whiche is, the preſeruation and ſafetie of the minde. For mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:7047:72"/>
and temperance in this part, is the health and ſoundeneſſe of the minde and witte of man: which (while it is wanting) is either vtterly ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwen, or elſe ſo feeble and weake, as euerie one may deſcrie it, for the dulneſſe and feebleneſſe that is in it.</p>
            <p>Adulterie being forbidden, the godly &amp; chaſte life of married folkes muſt needes be commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: which that it may be perfourmed, Almightie God requireth of his children, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they do match the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues with ſuch as feare him and ſerue him after his worde: ſuche hathe he promiſed to bleſſe. As for thoſe that marrie for riches, beautie, and ſuche outward thinges, when there is not the feare and true worſhippe of God ioyned withal, they haue alwayes taſted of moſt grieuous plagues from the hand of the Lorde. This vnequall matching of the godly and godleſſe (for ſo I call all of them that are not humbled to ſerue God after his word) was the cauſe of that vniuerſal floude whiche did ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowe the worlde in the dayes of Noe, according as it is written in Geneſis:<note place="margin">Gene. 6.2.3.</note> 
               <hi>Then the ſonnes of God ſawe the daughters of men that they were faire, &amp; they toke them wiues of all that they liked. Therefore the Lord ſaid, My ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite ſhal not alwayes ſtriue with man, becauſe he is but fleſhe, &amp;c.</hi> Here vppon we ſee the euill beginning, and the iuſt puniſhment of ſuche as pollute marriage, whiche ſhoulde be kept in all obedience and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.

            <p>Nowe if the nource be a drie nource, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing

any true feare and ſeruice of God, ſhal ſhe not be guiltie of thoſe that ſterue vnder her hand? Or ſhal their cruel careleſneſſe be vnpuniſhed that dare commit heires of ſo great an inheritance vnto ſuch nources deſtitute altogether of any nouriſhment fitte and conuenient for them.</p>
            <p>The learned giue this reaſon (why in the books of kinges there is ſo continuall mention made of their mothers who were Kings) that the children are by nature giuen to followe muche the inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their mothers, and that education whiche they receiue from them: and therefore that dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent care ſhould be had to make ſuche choice, as were likely to bring the benefite of Chriſtian edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to their children and poſteritie.

               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 7.</note> As this choice is the beginning of a godly and chaſte life, ſo loue and heartie good affection is the thing that doth continue it.

This alſo had the Lorde reſpect vnto in that lawe,<note place="margin">Num. 5.12.</note> which (as we haue heard before) was made to cure the iealous affection of the man.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:7047:73"/>This loue ſhall then be ſurely continued when either partie ſhall perfourme that which the Lord hath laide vpon them, humbling themſelues vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> burden of obedience which he hath charged the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> withal:<note place="margin">Peter. 3.7.</note> which is: for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> man, (as we are taught by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apoſtle Peter) that he giue honour vnto the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man as the weaker veſſel, making a ſupplie of her weakeneſſe, and that want whiche by nature ſhee hathe of many gyftes graunted vnto man, by his loue and hartie good affection declared vnto her, euen as in the bodie of man, the ſtronger members giue diligent care and ſupport vnto the weaker: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes taking heede that he ſuffer no contempte to abide in his heart (much leſſe in his dede) towards her, who is fellowe heire with him of the grace of life (as the Apoſtle witneſſeth in the ſame place) &amp; therfore may not haue her life made (by contempt or outragious dealing) ſo bitter and grieuous as it may rather be called a curſe, then a grace and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull gyft of God.</p>
            <p>But the chiefe cauſe whiche ſhoulde moue a chriſtian moſte, is, left their prayers and ſeruice of God be reiected: whiche cannot be acceptable vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him while there abideth wrathe and diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the hart towards any, but eſpecially if there be iarring and diſſention with thoſe with whome we ſhould be moſte at one.

For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wife, it is required by the apoſtle in the ſame place, that ſhe be of a meeke, gentle, and quiet ſpirit, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che the holy ghoſt requireth her to be apparelled withall, ſetting it in the place of all outward vaine attyring of them ſelues, as that which is precious before God, and moſt able to allure the heartes of good men: affirming this to haue beene the attire of holy wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in times paſt which truſted in god: who for that they truſted in him, committed them felues to the ornamentes preſcribed by him: not fearing contempt, but aſſuredly beleeuing that in that his way, he both coulde and woulde giue fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour vnto them in the eyes of their husbandes. It is worthy the noting, that hee maketh it the attyre of them that truſted in God: for therein he plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly giueth foorth, that the outwarde vaine ſetting out of them ſelues, ſauoureth of miſtruſt and feare of contempt, whatſoeuer be pretended: and that (if they truſt in God) they ſhall not neede to feare that their meekneſſe and quietneſſe can bring any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt with it, but that it ſhall be rewarded with li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king from the Lord. It is alſo required that they be reuerently ſubiect vnto their husbandes in all things as was Sarai, who vſed ſuch ſpeach of reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, (calling him ſyr,) as did witneſſe of the heart that it did honour him: which if it be refuſed, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is that benefite graunted vnto their weakneſſe (of a head and guide) acknowledged, (whiche is great vnthankfulneſſe both vnto God and to their

husbande) neither yet that gouernement obeyed, which the Lord hath put them vnder, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable diſobedience. The place therefore that they are in, muſt be acknowledged with all humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie: and the duties laide vpon them by the Lorde perfourmed, that there may bee continuance of their godly and chaſte loue. Thus no occaſion muſt be giuen vnto ſathan by either of them (tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough alienation of minde and breach of loue in not perfourming their ſeuerall dueties) to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny way or paſſage to the vngodly and vnchaſt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king or vſing of any other. Yong men ſhall then giue them ſelues to the dueties of this commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, when they ſhall haue learned ſobrietie &amp; temperaunce, a gifte that brideleth their affections in pleaſures (as eating, drinking, and vaine ſetting forth of them ſelues in apparel,) not ſuffering them to haue all that they require herein, but cutting the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhort of that they wold, yea, of ſome part and of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> alſo which honeſtly they might haue: alwayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhort, rather than in any reſpect beyond that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> is conuenient for men of their degree, ſo that they neede not to feare the iudgement of any indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent men, being alwayes a good deale within the compaſſe of their ſtate and calling, but neuer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out: giuing foorth teſtimonie by that meanes to al men, of their modeſt, temperate, and ſober minde, which the holy Ghoſte calleth the ornament of young men. And the Apoſtle Paule warneth Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus to exhorte them vnto this gifte and grace of young yeares,<note place="margin">Tit. 2.6.</note> a verie profitable meane to driue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way

Women alſo are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted vnto this temperance, and ſobrietie, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to modeſtie, and ſhamefaſtneſſe which is the roote and beginning of it, by the Apoſtle Paule to Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothie: who willeth in that place,<note place="margin">1.

For therefore it is called tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce, bycauſe it reſtraineth a man of his libertie. But in this our age, when almoſt all goe as farre as they may, and the moſt part both of men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men a great deale beyond their compaſse, where is this temperance and ſobrietie, which is ſo high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commended in the Scriptures, the verie walles of pure life, and barres of chaſt conuerſation? This may be bewayled of all men, but the diſeaſe is ſo vniuerſall, as it is impoſsible to be cured, if the lord ſhall not put to his mightie hand from heauen. It will be ſayde that it is hard to meaſure theſe indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent things: but the trueth is otherwiſe, for the holy Ghoſt hath ſent vs a meaſure and meteyard, euen ſham efaſtneſſe and temperance: ſo that when there is no moderation or temperance, but that by euerie indifferent iudgement, they bee as farre as their eſtate can giue them leaue, when there is no ſhamefaſtneſſe, but that they dare bee bolde to goe without bluſhing as farre as their place or abilitie can leade them, maye wee not bolde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay, that they haue left the Lorde his meaſure?

            <p>This temperaunce is to be taught the yonger ſort not onely from the mouth of the elder, but fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their life and conuerſation: that they may be kept in thoſe means which do vphold chaſt behauiour: and therefore the Apoſtle Paule chargeth Titus that he ſtirre vp the elder both men and women,<note place="margin">Titus. 2.2</note> to ſeaſon yong yeares therewith.

<pb n="134" facs="tcp:7047:76"/>
man. For if any thing of his, paſsing through out handes, ſhall not finde fidelitie and faythfull dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, but deceitfull conueyaunce of it or ſome parte thereof to oure ſelues, can it bee truely ſayde, wee loue the man? there is no man that can ſo iudge of it: that can I ſay perſuade him ſelfe that hee is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued of thoſe men, when nothing of his goodes commeth to their handes, but it is ſure to be flee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and to pay toll before it ſhall depart. The Lord therefore (commaunding ſafe paſſage and louing dealing towardes our neighboures goodes, when ſo euer (according to the manifold neceſsities of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie man, to deale and communicate with an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in buying and ſelling, or otherwiſe) they haue occaſion to paſſe through our handes) hath forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den ſtealing, and all vnfaithfulneſſe in their goods: condemning it of want of charitie and loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes them ſelues, whoſe goods are diminiſhed by vs, when ſo euer we ſhal haue dealing with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And bicauſe we goe ſo cloſely to work, and are ſo cunning to deceiue our ſelues, imagining that wee loue our neighbours, when in deede there is no ſuch affection in vs, the holy Ghoſte is compelled as it were to trace vs, and by ſuch vnfaithful foote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps as theſe be, to deſcrie vs. For when we are ſo often taken with vntruſtie dealing, and vnfayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, in our neighbours goods, good name, and ſuch like: is there not iuſt cauſe to areſt vs for not diſcharging this duetie of loue, which is ſo due vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:7047:76"/>This vnfaythfull dealing with the goodes of our neighbour, howe greatly it did diſpleaſe the Lorde, and with what lawes he did reſtraine his people of Iſrael from the ſame, the ſtatutes and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of that gouernement can beſt declare: from whence it ſhall not be amiſſe to take ſome helpe in the interpretation of this commaundement. In Exodus we doe reade,<note place="margin">Exo. 22. verſe. 1.4.</note> that if any man ſhould ſteale a ſheepe, and kill it, or ſell it, he ſhould reſtore for that one ſheepe, foure: but if any man ſhould ſteale an oxe, and after kill it, or ſell it, hee ſhould reſtore fiue oxen for that oxe. The reaſon why he muſt pay more for the oxe then for the ſheepe, was, for that his neighbours loſſe was greater in the want of the one then of the other, as bringing more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite to the owner thereof. But if they were found with the theefe aliue, not ſolde nor killed, then muſt hee reſtore but the double of the oxe, aſſe, or ſhepe, for that his obſtinacie in this euil did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare ſo greate, as when hee ſhould make ſale of them, and turne them into gaine.</p>
            <p>For it might be, while they were aliue, that he being touched with repentaunce, woulde reſtore them againe: but when they were ſolde or killed, the theefe gaue greater token of his impudencie, and confirmed obſtinacie, and the owner alſo was one degree further from any likelyhoode to come by them againe. If the theefe be nothing worth, and ſo not able to make reſtitution, then as it is there declared, he muſt be ſolde.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:7047:77"/>Thus did the iuſt God in the olde Teſtament, by lawes made for that purpoſe, and puniſhments appointed accordingly, declare his hatred of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, and in what reckoning it commeth before his iudgement ſeate: that we might take light at his iudgement, howe to diſcerne of theft, and how to iudge of this kynde of hatred towardes our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, that bewrayeth it ſelfe in ſo vniuſt dealing with his goods.</p>
            <p>The loue that wee muſte ſhewe foorth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes our neighbour by dealing well with his goods, may not only be ſeene in this law (ſo ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly puniſhing the thefe for his want of loue euident<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly appearing in his theft and iniurie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted) but alſo in the lawe made for him, that ſhould borrow any of his neighbours goods. Which lawe did very well prouide for faithfull dealing with it, in puniſhing the contrarie ſo ſharply, as his vnfayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe (howe great ſo euer) ſhould gaine him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all. For thus it is written in Exodus: <hi>If a man borrowe ought of his neighbour,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exo. 22.14</note> 
               <hi>and it be hurt, or elſe dye, (the owner thereof not being by) hee ſhall ſurely make it good.</hi> If it be an hyred thing, he ſhall not make it good, it came for his hyre. It appeareth here plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the owner muſt haue his loſſe made good of the borrower, vnleſſe his owne eyes could teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, that the hurt or loſſe thereof came not through any default of the borrower. But he that ſhall lend for hyre, muſt ſtand to the aduenture of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall if it decay. The reaſon is rendred, bicauſe it came for hyre, and not of loue alone, as did the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:7047:77"/>
thing borrowed. And therefore the reaſon is good, why hee ſhould not be charged in this caſe, as the borrower, to make good that which he hath hired being hurt or dead. Marke well I pray you this lawe of God for lending and hyring: that the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower muſt make good things borrowed, if they decay, but not the hyrer. Marke it well I ſay, for this is the ground of many thinges that are to be ſpoken of hereafter.</p>
            <p>The equitie of this lawe, bringeth great light to diſcerne of the vſuries that are ſo common at theſe dayes. In things borrowed (it appeareth by this lawe) that only the hurt or death of the goods was prouided for. Here is then no helpe for mony that is borrowed or lent, which periſheth not with vſe, but is ſtill of the ſame value and worth that it was at the firſt deliuerie of the ſame. Beſides that, if it were worſſe for the vſe, there is no more requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red but to make the decay of it good. Howe then can thoſe who lend their monie to vſurie (whiche decayeth not with vſe) clayme any thing aboue that which was deliuered? By this lawe of lend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, their recompence was commaunded onely in this title, that the thing by lending was certeinly knowne to be impayred. Howe dare then the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurers claime a right of recompence, vnder none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther title, but that it was likely with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vſe thereof, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they might in that time, thus and ſo greatly haue gained? It is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> equitie of God, to require no reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence for the vſe of things that are the worſſe with vſing, ſo long as there appeareth no caſuall hurt (as
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:7047:78"/>
we call it) of the whole. What equitie then muſt it be, that for thinges not worſſe with vſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenteth not it ſelfe, no, not with the whole? Here, in this law of God good wil is no better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenced, but that it be no looſer: Shall a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous deſire then ſo richly be requited, as that it ſhall bee ſure alwayes to come home a gayner? By this equitie of God, when it is certeinly kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen, that by the vſe of the thing borrowed, the borrower hath good gaine, yet doth the almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie allowe no returne of commoditie to the len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for that gayne. By what equitie then can the vſurer clayme gaine for the vſe, yea oftentimes when it is certeine there is no gaine gotten at all? By this lawe of GOD, the lender could neuer gayne: for there is no other prouiſo made but for his principall: by ouer practiſe, he is euer aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of gayne. By that lawe, the borrower was aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of the gaine that was to returne to him: by this practiſe, the lender is oftentimes the whole gayner. If it be graunted, that this lawe of God in borrowing and lending haue in it any equitie, this practiſe in borrowing and lending of monie, muſt bee condemned of playne wrong and iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, as directly ſtanding againſt the ſame.</p>
            <p>If this dealing, ſhall feare the ſtrict iuſtice of borrowing and lending, and ſeeke couert vnder the libertie of thinges let out to hyre, it is alſo ſhut out there, and findeth worſſe interteynment. For hyred thinges, bycauſe they goe for hyre, haue not the ordinarie allowaunce of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:7047:78"/>
if they ſhall decay, which borrowed thinges iuſtly claime, bicauſe they come freely and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hire: therfore the law y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we had of hyred thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, handleth the vſurer more hardly, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that law of borrowing &amp; lending. For here, bycauſe of his hyre, he hath no holde of the principal if it decay.</p>
            <p>Thus if it ſhould be graunted that monie may be hyred, which I thinke neuer can be proued: yet muſt it bee with hazard of the principall, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the equitie of this lawe. That by the equitie of this lawe, (which is the equitie of God) it can haue no better allowance (if it ſhall bee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued lawfull to let it out for hyre,) then to ſtande to the daunger and decaye of the principall, theſe reaſons will plainely proue: The goods whiche naturally yeald commodities in the vſe of them to him that poſſeſſeth them, as ſheepe, and ſuche other, muſte ſtand to the aduenture of decay, if they be hyred: therefore muche more muſt they doe ſo, which naturally and of them ſelues yeald no commodities.</p>
            <p>The goodes that in yealding their commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities doe ſpend and we are away them ſelues, are contented with their hyre, and lay no clayme to haue the whole repayred. By what iuſtice then may goodes that are neuer a whit the worſſe for wearing, beſides their hyre, binde a man to vphold the whole? If it bee equitie, that thoſe goodes which naturally of them ſelues yeald by vſe a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine gayne, ſhould not be charged with the daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of decay, it is againſt all equitie, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thoſe things
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:7047:79"/>
which neyther of them ſelues, nor yet with like certentie yeald the commoditie, ſhould beſide their hire, haue the whole vpholden. To conclude, if thoſe goods which (by all mens iudgement) may moſt lawfully haue conſideration for their vſe, be not better conſidered, it ſeemeth to me good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, why thoſe goods (which the moſt thinke are not at all to haue hyre for their vſe, and all men thinke, they may not ſo iuſtly require it as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) ſhould hold them ſelues well contented, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their allowance is as good as theirs is, whiche beſt do deſerue it.</p>
            <p>If any man ſhall replie, and ſay that ſome of great deſeruing in the Church of God, men of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular learning and iudgement, haue thought and taught otherwiſe: Let them vnderſtand, that there is no vſurie that is nowe in vſe with vs that can be vpholden by their doctrine. For proofe whereof, I referre my ſelfe vnto that, whiche is written by that worthie inſtrument of God Maiſter Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine vpon this matter in his Commentaries vpon Ezechiel Chapter eighteene:<note place="margin">Eze. 18.</note> a man that hathe ſayde the moſt for the allowance of vſurie in ſome ſpeciall caſes, his wordes are theſe: <hi>Nunc videndum eſt, quando, &amp; a quibus, accipere foenus liceat.

We ſee in this commaundement, what hedges and fences the Lorde hath made for the ſafetie of our goods, to reſerue the proprietie and benefite thereof vnto our ſelues: and to keepe vs alſo from witneſsing any want of loue, by brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:7047:80"/>
in vpon any other mens goods, vnlawfully. This want of loue, witneſſed by euill dealing with oure neighbours goodes, was likewiſe prouided for by lawes made for their faithfull dealing, that had any thing giuen them to keepe. We reade in Exodus,<note place="margin">Exo. 22.7.</note> that if a man deliuer his neighbour mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie or ſtuffe to keepe, and it bee ſtolne out of his houſe, if the theefe be found, he ſhall pay the debt: if the theefe be not founde, then the maiſter of the houſe muſt be brought vnto the Iudges to ſweare, whether hee haue put his hand vnto his neighbors goods to defraud him of it or no: not beeing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted of that ſuſpicion, before he had purged him ſelfe by an othe. But if a man ſhall deliuer vnto his neighbour to keepe, aſſe, oxe, or ſheepe, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny beaſt, and it die, or be hurt, or taken away by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimies, and no man ſee it, the owner (hearing him teſtifie by an othe that there was no deceit of his part in the matter) muſt holde him ſelfe contented therewith. If it were ſtolne from him to whom it was giuen to keepe, hee muſt make reſtitution to the owner thereof, bycauſe therein appeared his negligence. If it were torne in peeces (which might bee, notwithſtanding his diligence were neuer ſo good) he muſt bring ſome part of it, and ſhew that it was deuoured, and in ſo doing, hee is not bound to make it good,<note place="margin">Exo. 22.11 12.13.</note> as appeareth in Exodus. Theſe te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies are here brought in, to teſtifie how care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full the Lorde is of faythfull and louing dealing with our neighbours in their goods, and to let vs ſee and vnderſtand, that wee are not ſo free from
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:7047:80"/>
duties in that behalfe, as commonly we are wont to eſteeme our ſelues to bee: but that wee ſtande bound before the Lord, to leaue recordes behinde vs of our louing affection towards them, when ſo euer by any occaſion wee ſhall haue to deale with their goods.</p>
            <p>What naturall man canne bee perſuaded, that there is any conſcience binding to reſtore goodes that were put in truſt vnto him, if they ſhould be ſtolne? What naturall man would not fret and fume at this, that when his neighbour ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth requeſt vnto him to keepe it, hee ſhould not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding bee bound to aunſwere it if it were ſtolne, or be troubled for his goodwill, to purge him ſelfe before a magiſtrate by an othe, that there was no vnfaithful dealing on his parte with thoſe goodes? Would not fleſh and bloud ſtorme at this, as an vnlawfull and vniuſt thing? But the iuſt Lorde, by theſe lawes letteth vs ſee that wee ſtand more bound vnto louing dealing with our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours in their goodes, than our corrupt nature woulde willingly yealde vnto. And thoſe lawes are good glaſſes for vs thus farre to looke into them, that wee may learne that wee are bounde to ſhewe more fidelitie and loue towardes oure neighbours in their goodes, then our corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can bee brought with any goodwill to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge.</p>
            <p>The negligence, whereby an other man ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red loſſe or damage in his goodes, was accounted as a kynde of deceite and iniurie before the Lord:
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:7047:81"/>
&amp; he was bound to make it good, through whoſe negligence it did periſh, according as it is written in Exodus:<note place="margin">Exo. 21.33.</note> When a man ſhall open a well, or dig a pit, and couer it not, and an oxe or an aſſe fal ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, the owner of the pit ſhal make it good, and giue monie to the owners thereof, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dead beaſt ſhal be his. What ſhall we then think of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate purpoſe, wittingly and willingly ſhal bring damage or loſſe to their neighbours? when care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe negligence (not being ioyned with any pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to hurt or impoueriſh) is bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to make good the hurte and damage of his negligence, and yet nothing is ſo common nowe a dayes (euen among chriſtians and goſpellers) as vpon the leaſt grefe or diſpleaſure conceiued, to force a man to ſpend his monie and goods in ſuite of lawe. Theſe men are farre from fearing the puniſhment of negligence, while their deliberate purpoſe without any law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full cauſe to impaire his wealth, is accounted as no fault with them, no not halfe the price of their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, be it neuer ſo vniuſtly or without cauſe conceiued.</p>
            <p>We haue heard how carefull the Lorde is to make ſafe paſſage for our goodes, whether they come within the coaſt of the borrower, receyuer, or careleſſe paſsinger. The ſame care hath he alſo of them, when they muſt paſſe by the buyer or ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler. For euen the buyers and ſellers haue charge to deale well with them, that there appeare not lacke of loue towardes the owners, by the their doings and dealings with their goods. And therefore our
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:7047:81"/>
owne greedie affections muſt not make the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, nor ſet the price vppon the thinges that are to be ſolde, but the worthineſſe of the thing it ſelfe that is to be bought or ſolde, &amp; the benefite that it is likely to yeelde to him that ſhall inioy it, muſte ſtrike the ſtroke.</p>
            <p>A lawe was giuen vnto the people of Iſrael for fidelitie and faithfull dealing in buying &amp; ſelling, as appeareth in Leuiticus:<note place="margin">Leuit. 25.14.15.16.17.</note> 
               <hi>When thou ſelleſt any thing to thy neighbour, or buyeſt at thy neighbours hand, ye ſhal not deceiue one another, but according to the nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of yeres af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Iubilie, thou ſhalt buy of thy neighbour: alſo accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the number of the yeeres of the reuenewes hee ſhall ſell vnto thee: according to the multitude of yeeres thou ſhalt increaſe the price thereof, and according to the fewneſſe of yeeres thou ſhalt abate the price of it: for the number of fruites doeth he ſel vnto thee. Oppreſſe not yee therefore any man his neighboure, but thou ſhalt feare thy GOD, for I am the Lorde your GOD.</hi> Theſe are the verye wordes of the texte. At the yeere of <hi>Iubilie</hi> euerie manne returned againe to his landes and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions that he had ſolde and made away: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as that yeere was further off or neerer, ſo they bought and ſolde thinges deare or better cheape. And the reaſon and equitie of this lawe is added: for (ſayeth the holie Ghoſte) the number of frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes doeth hee ſell vnto thee, and thoſe canſt thou not haue after the yeere of <hi>Iubilie,</hi> and therefore if he ſhoulde ſell otherwiſe then after that rate, hee ſhould take in ſome money of thee, not giuing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:7047:82"/>
thing out for it: for the number of fruites doeth he ſell vnto thee. As if he ſhould ſay, he hath not righte to take, but in regarde of that fruite and commoditie that doeth come vnto thee, by that which he doeth ſell thee. For he maketh this the reaſon (why he muſt abate according to the neere approching of <hi>Iubilie,</hi>) becauſe the other after that time, could receiue no benefite of that whiche hee bought: as if it were an vndoubted trueth, that there muſt be ſome equalitie of mutual benefite betwene the buyer and the ſeller, that a man may not take money for nothing of his neighbour, but muſt giue him a penie worth for his penie. The yeere of <hi>Iubilie</hi> is gone, with other the like lawes made for the gouernement of that people: but the reaſon and equitie of this lawe ſtandeth, and bindeth vs to haue conſcience in our buying and ſelling, &amp; not to let our couetous affection ſet the price vpon that we haue to ſell.</p>
            <p>Out of the equitie of this lawe, which yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth, (beeing the equitie of that GOD which cannot be contrarie to himſelfe,) it appeareth, that the ſeller muſt in ſelling looke what commoditie and benefite it is likely that the buyer ſhall inioy by that which he ſelleth vnto him, making con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecture thereof according vnto the vſuall rate of thoſe wares as they go at that time, and to increaſe or abate the price of his wares, or that hee hath to ſel whatſoeuer accordingly. For they muſt buy and ſell according as the yeere of <hi>Iubilie</hi> (whiche
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:7047:82"/>
beeing once come they might no longer inioy it) was ſooner or later, increaſing the price, if it were longer to that yeere, becauſe the buyers commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie ſhould increaſe: and abating the price, if the time were ſhorter, becauſe the buyers commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie muſt be ſo much the leſſe.</p>
            <p>By the equitie and reaſon of this lawe, we may lerne two rules, which wil teach vs to diſcerne wel of true buying &amp; ſelling, &amp; learne vs to buy and ſel in the feare of God &amp; with a good conſcience. The firſte is, that our couetous affection muſte not ſett the price of that we vtter. For here we ſee he muſt haue an eye to that time, when the others com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie muſt ceaſſe, and take his rule from thence: ſo that hee is ſent from him ſelfe in making of the price, and muſt looke at an other. This is the firſte rule giuen vs to buy and ſell by, and is drawen from the equitie of this lawe, whiche is the equitie of our GOD.</p>
            <p>A meruaylous good rule, ſauouring of loue to our neighbour, and brideling ſelfe-loue, whiche without regarde of others, loketh to it ſelfe alone. If this rule were obſerued, then ſhould theſe ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches ceaſſe in Chriſtian mouthes, and not bee hearde, I may and will ſell thus, becauſe I haue had loſſes heeretofore: or I will ſell as I can get for my wares how ſoeuer, becauſe I may haue loſſes hereafter, and this muſt helpe to beare when that commeth: As if wee had commiſſion from the Lord, to take vp vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> buyer, our ſhipwracks, or the recompence of our loſſes what ſo euer:
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:7047:83"/>
or as if we had authoritie, to lay thoſe ſtrokes vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon his ſhoulders, that ſhould firſte deale with vs, whiche wee haue iuſtly borne from the hande of the Lorde.</p>
            <p>It were very requiſite, if any doe ſo, that his commiſſion were ſeene why hee ſhould ſo doe: for ſure it is, the Lord giueth not out any ſuche large commiſſion, as by vertue whereof any may challenge a recompence in another mans goods, when ſoeuer the Lord for iuſt cauſes hath thought it good to diminiſh his. The ſecond rule is, that in buying and ſelling, wee driue the commodities giuen and receiued as neere equalitie as poſſibly we can: that ſo farre foorth as wee can gather (by the preſent value, rate, and account that is made of thoſe things exchaunged) there be equall commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities comming to bothe the parties by that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunge, &amp; that neither partie be a deceiuer, or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſour of his brother: for ſuche hath the Lorde threatened that he will be reuenged of. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this reaſon is giuen (why hee muſt take leſſe if the time be neerer, when the buyer ſhall forgoe his commoditie:) for (ſayth the texte) thou ſelleſt him the fruites, and the fruites he can no longer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy: and if he ſhould ſay, hee can no more haue commoditie of that which he bought of thee, and therefore muſt thy price bee abated accordingly, that there may be mutuall benefite, &amp; neither parte be found oppreſſing an other. For thou art not li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed to take any penie from thy brother for nothing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="149" facs="tcp:7047:83"/>Thou muſt (as nigh as thou canſt diſcerne) giue him as good as thou takeſt: thou art bounde to giue him a penie worth for his penie, and a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie for his penie worth. Thou maiſt not doe that to him, which thou wouldſt be loth that he ſhould doe to thee. Thou wouldeſt not that hee ſhould take any commoditie from thee, vnleſſe hee gaue thee the worth of it againe.</p>
            <p>I perceiue the time paſſeth, and I haue muche yet to ſpeake of this matter: I will therefore heere make an ende, reſeruing the reſte vntill the nexte day. Now let vs call vppon our heauenly father in the name of his ſonne, that wee may wittneſſe the loue whiche wee beare vnto our brethren, by all faithfull and louing dealing with their goods. &amp;c.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E learned the laſte day, that a man might not take any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie from another, vnleſſe he gaue the worthe of it againe. This rule ſaith ſore to the vſuall buyings, &amp; ſellings of theſe daies when commonly all men regarde them ſelues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, to make the moſte they can of their commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, without any regarde had what his commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie is like to be that dealeth with them, by that which he receiueth from them. Yet it is no other
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:7047:84"/>
rule, but that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon one which we haue receiued by the light of nature, that wee may not doe that vnto another, we woulde not haue done vnto our ſelues. And who (I pray you) would haue the worſe at an other mans hand? Who would haue willingly leſſe giuen him then hee had deliuered vnto an other? Or who could beare, that another man ſhould haue no regard how well or ill he had dealte with him? Then may wee not doe ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to others.</p>
            <p>Wee muſt therefore thinck, that when wee come to buying and ſelling, we come to wittneſſe our loue towardes our neighboure by our good dealing with him in his goods, and to leaue ſome teſtimonie of the feare of God, and a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence behinde vs: we come to make tryall of our faith to God, while we depend vppon his bleſſing for our prouiſion to liue well and happily, in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the rule of loue and vpright dealing, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che he hath left vs, and not the deſire of our owne rauinous affection. But in verye deede, if a man ſhould looke to the dealinges that now are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in the worlde in all buyinges, ſellinges, and exchau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges, he muſt be forced to confeſſe that men come to buying and ſelling as it were to the razing and ſpoiling of ſome enimies citie or holde, where euery man catcheth, ſnatcheth, and carrieth away, whatſoeuer he can come by: &amp; he is thought y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beſt that carrieth away the moſte: his botie is taken to be the warmeſt, that hath made the moſte naked in
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:7047:84"/>
the ſtreetes: he commeth home the merrieſt, that hath cauſed the moſte weeping and wayling, ſighing and ſobbing, to vtter the heauineſſe of the heart. Yet in all this oppreſſion, euery ſuch offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der perſuadeth him ſelfe that he is not out of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie with his neighbour, but that hee loueth him entirely and ſheweth it well enough: for he giueth him good wordes in buying and ſelling, and hee intendeth no hurt vnto his perſon. But the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Ghoſte will bringe vs to another tryall of our loue, he will not be bound to that alone: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doeth ſend vs to ſee how louing wee are, by our dealing with him in his goods.</p>
            <p>Therefore doeth the Apoſtle ſay very well to the Romanes, that this commandement,<note place="margin">Rom. 13.9.</note> 
               <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſteale,</hi> is as the reſt fulfilled no otherwiſe then by loue. Theſe oppreſſions therefore, theſe fraudes and deceiptes to pul another mans goods into our hands that are ſo rife euery where, doe no leſſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare our want of loue (by the teſtimonie of the Apoſtle) then doe murthers, ſlaughters, and bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed.</p>
            <p>Now to come to the matter more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by this rule is condemned all vttering of naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and conterfaite coyne or ware. For how can there be equalitie of commodities, where the one is not commodious or profitable at all?</p>
            <p>Secondly, here is condemned all that vttering of money or wares (though good in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues) whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che haue ſome thinges cloſely ioyned with them,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:7047:85"/>
to vtter them with all and to increaſe the price aboue that which they are worth, and without thoſe additions, doe vſually go for: which thinges are no commodities nor merchandize at all of them ſelues, neither will they alwayes abide with the vſe of the thinges, and departing, they cannot but bring loſſe vnto him that muſt haue the vſe of them, and leaue him (as we ſay) in the laſhe.</p>
            <p>In this number are all thoſe, that ſell their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities what ſoeuer, dearer then otherwiſe they are ſolde for in thoſe times, becauſe they giue day with them, and longer time before they bee payed, taking money for time, and making it to increaſe, and add to the value of their commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities.</p>
            <p>Firſt vnderſtand, that time is no merchaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize: for who dare bee ſo bolde as to ſay that hee hath brought time into the market to ſel? or who hath giuen thee leaue to ſell dayes and monethes? There muſt alſo bee equalitie of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities: the man hath giuen out for time, but when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to the vſing or wearing of that thinge, hee findeth no benefite by reaſon of that time, which he hath paide for. In deede if a coate or cloake-cloathe ſolde dearer for time, would bee longer time in wearing then another coate of the ſame or like peece ſolde for preſent money, there were ſome reaſon in it, becauſe the buyer ſhould haue the ſame commoditie of time in the vſing of it, that the other had in the ſale of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:7047:85"/>Or if the corne ſolde dearer for time, woulde feede a mans familie longer then ſo muche bought for readie money, there were ſomething to be ſaid for it. And if it be anſwered, that he who receiueth it of vs maketh a commoditie of time as we doe, for he ſelleth it thereafter, the matter is not yet anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, vnleſſe it be firſte proued that thou maiſt law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully take money for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>, whiche though peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture one do not loſe by, (through his as vniuſt dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling as thine owne) yet thou art ſure another can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but ſmart of it: for it commeth ſo muche the dearer to him that muſt vſe it, who reapeth no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie for time, but rather loſſe and hinderance, notwithſtanding it hath increaſed thy gaine. And who hath giuen thee leaue to take ſome thing the more for thy commoditie, in conſideration of that, whiche wilbe gone, when thy commodities ſhall come to be taken commoditie of, and to be put to the vſe, for the which they were bought and ſolde, that is, to occupie, ſpende or vſe them as their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth require? There is no equalitie in that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, when a man muſt giue out ſomething for that, whiche he is neuer a whit the more, but rather ſo much the leſſe, benefited by, whenſoeuer it ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be put vnto that vſe for the whiche it was made, &amp; in reſpect whereof we do take money for it, but in reſpecte of that commoditie which it will yeelde, when it ſhalbe put to that vſe and ende, whiche the nature of the thing requireth. Moreouer, if there be any thing of good reporte,<note place="margin">Phil 4.8.</note> we Chriſtians muſt ſeeke after it: and ſurely it can purchaſe no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:7047:86"/>
of brotherly dealing and good ſpeeche that way, when our dealinges ſhalbe harder, then the vſuall dealing of thoſe times are, euen among thoſe men that haue no other thing to gett their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing by, beſide the commoditie and profit that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth vnto them by that their trade. Herevnto may be added, that it is often preiudicial to the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable ſale of that man, who muſt ſell his wares for preſent money, his neceſſitie ſo conſtrayning him. The like is to be ſaid of other things, which (notwithſtanding they be good and ſufficient for the moſte parte therof, yet) haue ſomething min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled among to increaſe the quantitie, and ſo the price of the other: whiche in the vſe thereof, brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth no benefite, but hurt, hinderance, and deceipte vnto him that occupieth the ſame. One example may be this: Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cloathes are ſtretched fiue, ſixe, or ſeuen yardes in a cloathe aboue that whiche the cloath doth of neceſſitie require, it is well knowne vnto the ſeller who taketh money for the ſame, that all of them will ſhrinke in againe, ſo ſoone as euer they ſhalbe wet, and that the wearer ſhall haue no good by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And how then can theſe men take money for nothing? They can not be priuileged to take in ſome part of money for that, which hath no peece of commoditie in it, when it ſhall come to the triall and vſe that ſhould be of it.</p>
            <p>There is no equalitie, to take a commoditie for that, which in his handes or houſe if it lie by him, wil vaniſhe into nothing. It is no otherwiſe, then if ſome iuggler had cloſed in our fiſt, (as we thought)
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:7047:86"/>
ſome peece of coyne, but when we open our hand, there is no ſuche thing to be found there. As for their deſire to haue it ſo whiche doe buy it of vs, that cannot mainteyne any thing in vs, not lawfull of it ſelfe. For no mannes appetite can warrant our wrong dealing in deceiptfull wares. If the commoditie whiche we do vtter be neither altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, nor yet in part deceiptfull, but wholy good and ſufficient, yet if we ſhall ouer-ſell it, we treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe againſt this rule of equitie and reaſon, which forbiddeth the commoditie of one, to ariſe of the loſſe of another, and laboureth for equall commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie in exchaunge, as nighe as may be. Neither can we bee truely intituled vnto any other their commoditie, but by departing from ſome other thing of ours vnto them againe, as commodious as that is, and the ſame, either in weight, meaſure, or value. Thoſe men therefore that in buying and ſelling doe alwayes lay in wayte for them, who for ſome one neceſſitie or other, muſt neceſſarily vtter their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie, thinking to make a pray of their neceſſitie, &amp; to make y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> price after their owne luſt &amp; deſire, are not ſimple theeues: (for it ſkilleth not to make it theft, whether it be muche or litle y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we take fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> another which we haue no right vnto, nether yet whether it be done vnder ſome color, or without any ſhewe of right,) but alſo this kinde of dealing hath in it a ſpice and ſmacke of crueltie &amp; murther: becauſe it is toward thoſe moſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly whoſe neceſſitie (if there were any Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els in vs) were rather to be pittied as it alreadie
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:7047:87"/>
is, then further to be increaſed by vs: as if their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction were not yet enoughe to bee vnder our feete, vnleſſe we trampled vpon them, and did our good will that they might neuer ariſe againe.</p>
            <p>It is no more lawfull, to leaue teſtimonie that there is wante of loue towardes our neighbour by our dealing with his goods in buying and ſelling, then it is in our borrowing, keeping, or lending, as was before declared.</p>
            <p>For the Lorde hathe forbidden vs to ſhewe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny lacke of loue towardes our neighbour: and for triall of our obedience herein, he followeth our footing to the gate of his goodes, as well as to the doore of his perſon: to eſpie, whether we returne from thence bothe mercifull and helpefull, or cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell and hurtefull. For thus doth he trace vs and trie out our heart towarde our brethren, leading vs to ſee the ſecretes of it, by the out-goinges that it hathe to the thinges that be eſpecially neceſſarie and commodious for them, and alſo beſt beloued and moſt deare vnto them.</p>

Theſe thinges are expreſſely ſet downe in that place, to be reſtored in the whole and the fifte parte thereof added therevnto, at the ſummon of their conſcience whenſoeuer. It appeareth in the booke of Numbers,<note place="margin">Num. 5.8.</note> that the offenders in this parte, muſt pay this damage vnto his next kinſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, if he were dead whom thus they had wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged:
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:7047:88"/>
neither was he ſo acquited, if he had no kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, but muſt giue it to the Lord, for the prieſtes vſe. If ſo be it ſhal pleaſe the Lorde to call any man, and let him ſee an vniuerſall oppreſſion and harde dealing in all his doeing, not grieuing him with the alone remembrance of one, or ſome fewe, then the counſell of Daniel is to be followed:<note place="margin">Dan. 4.24.</note> to breake off their ſinnes by righteouſnes, and their iniquities by mercie toward the poore, that plentie of mercifull dealing may followe there, where there hath gone before great ſtore &amp; plentie of the contrarie.<note place="margin">Iſaie. 58.6.7</note> 
               <hi>Is not this the faſting,</hi> (ſayth the Prophete Iſaie) <hi>that I haue choſen, to looſe the bandes of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to take off the heauie burdens, and to let the oppreſſed goe free, and that ye breake euerie yoke? Is it not to deale thy bread to the hungrie, &amp; that thou bring the poore that wander vnto thine houſe? When thou ſeeſt the naked, that thou couer him? &amp;c.</hi> Thus muſt he not onely leaue oppreſſing, but alſo take vp mercifull dealing with the needie. We ſee howe by this whiche hitherto hathe beene ſaid, the Lorde hath fenced our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour his goods, and howe contrarie it is to the loue of our neighbour, to hurte or hinder him any way in them, and how agreeable to the wil of the Lord, that we ſhould be meanes that he might inioye the commodities thereof. Therefore was there a lawe among the children of Iſrael made to ſhewe their loue towardes their neighbour, who had planted a vineyard, but not taſted of the fruite therof: wherin it was prouided, that the officer ſhould make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation at their going to warfare againſt their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimies, that if there were any who had not eaten,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:7047:88"/>
of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fruite of their labours, they ſhuld returne home and take comfort and vſe of their owne. This lawe of loue, might not be diſpenſed withall, no not in the heate and vrgent neceſſitie of warres. A no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table teſtimonie to ſhewe howe well it liketh the Lord, that men ſhould take comfort of their own. As doth that Lawe alſo,<note place="margin">Deut. 19.14</note> which was giuen in Deu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teronomie of not remouing the lande-marke, which they of olde time haue ſet. And therefore we are commanded to ſhewe them this kindeneſſe and loue, to reſerue vnto them the comfort of their commodities, without impayring of them when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer we ſhal either borrowe, keepe, or finde any thing of theirs: or in buying and ſelling exchange with them. For we pleaſe God &amp; ſhew loue vnto them, whenſoeuer we ſhall deale truely with their goodes: according as we heard before, that God maketh trial of our hart toward our neighbour, by our handes, as they are wont to deale with them in their commodities. It is an vndoubted truth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that God is greatly pleaſed, when for obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence vnto him, we deale thus faithfully &amp; louing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in that which is theirs: it is a true fruite of loue, and a faithful obedience vnto this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement. And becauſe of that, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſoeuer it is done for obedience ſake vnto God, who doth comaund it, and of good wil vnto them who receiue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fruite of it, euen this fidelitie in his goodes that we bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe, finde, or be truſted withal, either elſe receiue by way of exchange, in buying &amp; ſelling, is a good worke in deede, and an humble obedience to the charge of God giuen vs in this commaundement.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="160" facs="tcp:7047:89"/>There are two thinges, without the whiche wee ſhall neuer be able to perfourme any acceptable o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to God in this commandement.</p>
            <p>The firſt is an aſſured faith in Gods promiſes, that he will prouide for vs, in the thinges neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie as well for the bodie as the ſoule: and that he hathe charged himſelfe, as well with the care and prouiſion for the one, as for the other. This faith (if it were true) woulde conſume many feares, and cares of our minde for worldly matters and works that followe the ſame. So might we employ our ſelues vppon the care of better thinges. This did the holie Ghoſte knowe verie well, and therefore meaning to cure couetouſnes, he maketh the plaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of faithe, ſaying: <hi>Let your conuerſation be without couetouſneſſe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 13.5.</note> 
               <hi>for he hath ſaide, I wil not leaue thee, nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake thee.</hi> When our hearts ſhalbe fully perſuaded, that the Lorde will not leaue vs, nor forſake vs, we cannot be ſo greatly tormented with the care to liue and obteine neceſſarie thinges for vs, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſo ſtrong aſſuraunce for it as his promiſe, who hathe made all thinges of nothing with his worde. And therefore in the former place, exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them to conſcience in buying and ſelling: he ſendeth them to the couenant, ſaying: <hi>I am thy God:</hi> which wordes (as we haue learned in the firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement) conteine promiſes for al things nede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for this preſent life. If this be ſtedfaſtly belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that the Lord wil not leaue vs, nor forſake vs, there wilbe no doubt of our euill dealinges with the goodes of our neighbour: whether we buy or
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:7047:89"/>
ſell, borrowe, or keepe the thinges that be his.</p>
            <p>The ſeconde thing is, to finde a contented minde, with that which we haue alreadie, and therefore to ſtay in it, as in a riche portion, with great thankfulneſſe of heart to our God for it, bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring our port and countenance in all our doinges accordingly, without any exceeding whatſoeuer. For if once our affections ſhall ouerflowe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bankes of our owne condition, ſo that in minde we burne with the deſire of a better, our dooinges can neuer be perſuaded, that they muſt ſo nerely be loked at, but that they may borrowe a litle of conſcience &amp; equitie, to make the prouiſion according as the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire directeth. This doth the Apoſtle confirme in plaine ſpeeche to Timothe:<note place="margin">Timo. 6.9.</note> where after perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to be content with that we haue, (becauſe the gayne of godlineſſe is great,) he telleth vs plainly, that they who wilbe riche, fall into many tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſnares, and many noyſome luſtes: this is the danger of them, that are fallen ſo farre into friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippe and loue with a better eſtate, that they wilbe rich. This being once ſet downe and determined, not onely conſcience is conſtrained to depart, but alſo thankefulneſſe to God for our preſent eſtate doeth in like manner forſake vs.</p>
            <p>Let vs learne by this commaundemente to knowe our corrupt inclination toward the goodes of our neighbours, and ſo to viewe our deceiptes that haue beene in vs at any time, either in buying or ſelling, borrowing or keeping any thing of his, together with our corrupte inclination therevnto,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:7047:90"/>
that the remedie, of redemption (broughte vs by Ieſus Chriſte) may truely be taken holde of: and that wee being made comfortable in his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, may with courage goe about the obedience of his will in this commaundement ſo that ſtill we may be more and more freed of all manner of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipte, and more and more inabled to glorifie him, in all louing and faithful dealing with the goodes of others.</p>
            <p>Whiche that it may be perfourmed, let vs call vppon our heauenly Father in the name of his Sonne, that it would pleaſe him in the multitude of his mercie, to holde vs vp by the hope of his promiſes, that we ſtanding aſſured of his help, may not be drawen by any neceſſitie, to do contrarie to his bleſſed will; and alſo that we hauing a content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted minde, may not be tormented with the hungrie deſire of a better eſtate, which being once entred, vniuſt dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling cannot long be kept out.</p>

For herein the Lord will haue tryall of our loue towards them, as wel as in their bodie and goodes: and therefore chargeth vs no leſſe herein with duetie, then before he hathe done in other thinges that are deare and precious vnto them. Neither is there any late cauſe why we ſhould ſtande charged towards his crate &amp; good name, then towardes his goodes. For as the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſte witneſſeth in the Prouerbes:<note place="margin">Prou. 22.1.</note> good name is better then great richeſſe and the louing fauour of men whiche doeth followe it, is aboue ſiluer and aboue golde. This muſt cauſe vs to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come carefull, leſt we ſhould annoy him, in ſo great a benefite and treaſure of his, as credits and good name is, by good right accounted of by the holy Ghoſte. The togue therfore is here inioyned not to caſte foorth, by want of loue, any ſuche ſpeech as might leave behinde it the ſtayne and ſoyle of infamie &amp; reproche vpon his neighbour. That the hurt and annoyance of the tongue may rightly be conſidered vpon, it ſhalbe good to proceede to the danger and damage of it particularly. The firſt is, when in open place of iuſtice &amp; iudgement, any man ſhal of malice and will will, teſtifie or depoſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> whiche is vntrue againſt his neighbour. Which
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:7047:91"/>
howe heynous a thing it is before God, may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by the puniſhment, that the Lord did appoint for the tranſgreſſours herein: whiche was to haue the ſame puniſhment, that he ſhould haue had who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they did falſely accuſe, if the accuſation had beene proued true. As it is writen in Deuteronomie: <hi>And the Iudges ſhal make diligent inquiſition:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deu. 19.18.19.</note> 
               <hi>and if the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe be found falſe, &amp;c, then ſhall ye doe vnto him as hee had thought to do vnto his brother: ſo thou ſhalt take euill away froth of the middleſt of thee: and the reſt ſhall heare this and feare, and ſhall from henceforth commit no more an ſuch wickedneſſe among you. Therefore thine eye ſhall haue no compaſſion, but life for life, eye for eye, toothe for toothe, hande for hande, foote for foote.</hi> The falſe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe therfore in the judgement of God is as great an offender, as if he had done that in deed himſelf, whiche vntruly he doth charge another withal: &amp; therefore muſt he reckon with the Lord, for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting that ſinne himſelfe (howe heynous ſoeuer it ſhalbe) that by his teſtimonie and ſpeeche, an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is wrongfully blamed for. As for example: if he ſhall wrongfully accuſe a man of murder, he is in the ſame fault before God, as if he ſhould haue cutte any mans throate: for falſe witneſſe maketh them doers of that, which vntruly by wordes they put upon others. And becauſe of the daunger that might grow herein, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iudges were charged not to receiue teſtimonie of one alone againſt his negh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: but at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> leſt two ſhould teſtifie in euerie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, before any judgment ſhould go againſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> man.</p>
            <p>For when the teſtimonie of two or three is tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:7047:91"/>
examined, the falſehode (if there be any) may ſoone be found out, whiche might ham bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, couert vnder one mans teſtimonie alone. This may teache vs, howe carefull the Lorde is to preſerue the credite Of man, from the malice, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, and venome of a falſe witneſſe.</p>
            <p>The Lorde alſo hathe charged the judge moſte ſtrictly, that he hurt not the right and cauſe of any man with his tongue and ſentence: ſo carefull is the Lorde to keepe vs harmeleſſe from this mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that is ſo tickle vnto euil. Therefore Iudges, and thoſe that be in place of iuſtice, are charged in Exodus not to ouerthrowe the right of the poore in his ſuite:<note place="margin">Exo. 23.6.7.</note> but to keepe them farre from a falſe matter, either to pronounce it, or to admitte of it, becauſe (as it is there ſaide) the Lord wil not fie a wicked man. They are forbid there to receiue giftes, becauſe thoſe wil blinde the eyes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wiſe. Theſe are the charges that be giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto them that ſitte in place of iuſtice. For the Lord meaning to make an harborowe againſte all the winde wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of an euill tongue, woulde neuer leaue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> parte vncouered, where the weather were likes to bring the greateſt daunger. And if the Lorde ſo miſlike falſe witneſſe, that he would haue no place to be a ſanctuarie for it, he can neuer abide that wrong to be offered vnto him, that his owne ſacred ſeate of iuſtice ſhould become the throne thereof. It is no ſmall matter before the Lorde, to dare defile his ſeate with a falſe ſentence. And notwithſtanding it ſeeme no one matter to pronounce a falſe ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:7047:92"/>
and to beare out an euill man or euill matter, yet is it amongeſt the euils of the tongue the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt to ouerthrowe the right of the righteous, and to iuſtifie the wicked: and ſo muche the more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that throne of the Lord &amp; place of iuſtice &amp; execution for the wicked, is by that meanes made a denne of theeues and wickedneſſe. Can there be a more monſtruous ſinne then this of the tongue, to adiudge him the garland and crowne of a cleare and iuſt man, who hath deſerued the hyre and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of reproche euen from the ſeate of the Lord? And whiche more is, to make the Lorde to put the crowne vpon the head of the wicked, and the halter about the necke of a iuſt man, whyle ſitting in his place and ſeate, as it were in his name, and for him they doe it, iuſtifying by their ſentence, a wicked man or wicked mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whome the Lorde abhorreth: and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the iuſt, whom he approueth? The Lorde doth threaten them, that ſitting in place of iuſtice and iudgement, do bolſter euill men and euill mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, with thoſe puniſhments (and that in this life,) that of all others they doe moſte miſlike: euen to be in contempt, reproche, and inwarde miſliking of the people, according as we are taught by the holy Ghoſte in the Prouerbes:<note place="margin">Prou. 24.23</note> 
               <hi>It is not good to haue reſpect of any perſon in iudgement. He that ſaith to the wicked, thou art righteous, him ſhal the people curſe, and the multitude ſhal abhorre him, but to them that rebuke him ſhalbe fauour: and vppon them ſhal come the bleſsing of goodneſſe.</hi> It is feared leſt if men ſhould ſet them

ſelues in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> place againſt euil men &amp; cauſes, it were the way to make them ſubiecte to diſpleaſure and loſſe of fauour with many, without any gaine of good report: but the holy ghoſt ſaith in that place, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the bleſſing of good liking ſhalbe vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuch, wher as the other labouring (by vpholding euil matters) either to keepe friendſhip, or otherwiſe to make all ſtand in awe of their diſpleaſure, &amp; ſo to ſpeake of their greate authoritie with admiration of it, ſhall finde the contrarie: euen the ſecret miſliking of al, howſoeuer for a time feare may keepe it in, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly there be no exclamation &amp; outcrie againſt it.

For notwithſtanding it were ſet vp, yet muſt it of neceſſitie fall downe againe, if it ſhould finde none that would by the receyuing and approuing there of, vnderproppe it, and as it were lende their ſhoulders vnto it.

and much leſſe in place of iuſtice vſe our teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie againſt any, vpon no ſufficient ground, moued onely by the ſpeeche and reportes that runne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broade.

It is not lawfull for vs to agree with any againſte God. And as for that eaſie eare that ſo ſoone receiueth the ſlaunderers report, the holy Ghoſte giueth the medicine for it, in the Prouerbes: <hi>As the Northe winde driueth away the raine,</hi>

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous ſpeeche: the receiuer therefore muſt be as euill, as the firſt brocher: for if we had no recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers we ſhould haue no theeues.

            <p>We are to conſider that whiche oftentimes hath bene ſpoken before: y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> vnder one ſinne (as this bearing of falſe witneſſe) it is vſuall with the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie

            <p>This couering of offences may ſeeme a very pleaſant doctrine vnto the fleſh: for we are natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bent one to ſooth vp an other in ſinne, and no man to eſpie any fault, ſpecially in his friend &amp; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quayntance: at the leaſt if we ſhall ſee it, yet we wil not ſee it. But the holie Ghoſte is far from the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding of any ſuch kinde of paſſing by ſinnes and offences: for he meaneth, that couering of them by louing admonition and priuate exhortation, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che in cauſing a man to be aſhamed of them, and to leaue them, blotteth out the memorie of them bothe before God and man. So doeth the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle Iames expound this couering of ſinnes: <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren if any of you haue erred from the trueth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iam. 5.19. &amp;. 20.</note> 
               <hi>and ſome man hath conuerted him, let him knowe that hee whiche hath conuerted the ſinner fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> going aſtray out of his way, ſhall ſaue a ſoule from death, and ſhall hide a multitude of ſinnes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this doeth our Sauiour Chriſte exhorte vs in Matthew,<note place="margin">Matt 18.15.</note> affirming that if he which hath offen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded ſhall heare our admonition, and be ordered by it, we haue wonne our brother: that place is worth the diligent noting. For after that he hath ſpoken
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:7047:94"/>
of his care, for the loſt ſheep that leaueth ninetie &amp; nine, to ſeeke that one whiche was loſt, declaring alſo the ioy that he conceiueth after the finding of this one, foorthwith he maketh mention of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vp thoſe of our brethren who haue fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſinne or iniquitie, and therefore offended vs: chargeing vs with the ſeeking vp of them by bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly admonition, according as it is there plainly ſet foorth, as alſo in Leuiticus.<note place="margin">Leui. 19.17.</note> By theſe teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies is apparant, that louing and freendly admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the way to hide ſinne, and that diſſembling it, and not admoniſhing our brethren, is the hatred of them &amp; the procuring of the blazing abroade of it, becauſe we knowe that the Lord will not ſuffer him vnpuniſhed, but by puniſhing it, wil vtter and declare it. We therefore in diſſembling it, while that we ſhall not admoniſh them to leaue it, and ſo to haue it hid in the mercies of God, may truely be ſaid to hate them, and alſo to be in the ſame of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence and fault of publiſhers and blazers abroade of their ſinne, in as muche as through our negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, the Lord is forced to bring it to light, that ſo it may be cured. So that we muſt be farr from this hatred towarde them, nay, wee muſt ſo loue their credit, leſt they ſhould be put to ſome open puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ſhame for their ſinnes,<note place="margin">Matth. 1.</note> as that the very good affection that we beare vnto them, and griefe to haue them made a publique example of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch, moue vs by way of exhortation to preuent the publiſhing of it by ſome blaſte of ſore puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the Lorde.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="172" facs="tcp:7047:95"/>Wherin as we are to deale plainly, ſo muſt we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo deale in the ſpirit of meekeneſſe and mildeneſſe, according as wee are willed in the Epiſtle to the Galathians.<note place="margin">Gal. 6.1.</note> 
               <hi>Brethren, if any man be fallen by occaſion into any fault, ye which are ſpirituall, reſtore ſuche one with the ſpirite of meekeneſſe, conſidering thy ſelfe leaſt thou alſo bee tempted,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As the faintneſſe and want of loue which lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth a man in his ſinne, is iuſtly reproued: ſo that bluſtering heate that of a medicine in like manner maketh a poyſon, is no leſſe to bee reproued of want of loue towarde the good name and eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our brother. For there is no man y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> can ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily growe into any good lykinge of thoſe men, in whom he perceiueth there is no affection towards him: neither yet can well digeſt ſharpe medicines, though otherwiſe neuer ſo wholeſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e, if there ſhall be no ſuger to make it ſweete withall. We muſt therefore take heede leſt the medicine become vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable by our vnſkilfull handling it, and ſo we become no couerers of ſinne, but rather by dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſo rudely make him caſt off all care of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, letting the raynes go to all libertie of life with the vngodlie, while he ſeeth him ſelfe ſo hardly dealt with, &amp; the godly to haue caſt off all hope &amp; care of him. This is the cauſe why the Apoſtle in the Epiſtle to the Theſſalo.<note place="margin">2. Theſſ. 3.15</note> willeth them to admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh thoſe as brethren, who for their euill conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation did iuſtly ſtande excommunicate: <hi>Haue no familiar companie with him</hi> (ſayth the Apoſtle) <hi>that hee may be aſhamed, yet account him not as an enimie, but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh</hi>
               <pb n="173" facs="tcp:7047:95"/>
him as a brother. The nature of man is eaſily carried to offend in this parte, euen to ſeeme to come into ſome opinion of holineſſe, by coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all others as prophane, and reprouing them in ſuch a bluſtering ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner, as carrieth with it no ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification at all of louing affection towards them. We are therefore diligently to obſerue, that our heartes wittneſſe vnto our ſelues, the care we haue by our admonition, to haue them reclaimed from thoſe ſinnes: and then that we conſider, what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of dealing they are moſte like to profite by, that notwithſtanding wee may deale with ſome more roundly then with others, yet eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoſe may ſee them ſelues not deſpiſed of vs, nor yet altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deſpaired of, that they ſhould be in a manner cauſed to fall into the acquaintance and fellowſhip of the vngodly: and leſt that they ſhould onely ſee our affections eaſed vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, without further care of their good. If there be good affection towarde the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in deed, we ſhal eaſily auoyd both y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> extremes, that neither we ceaſſe to admoniſh them at al, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet in admoniſhing be ouer bitter towardes them. It is ſure y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> loue wil moderate both: hauing no other end in reprouing &amp; opening the euill, but to keepe him from perſiſting in it. In the handling alſo of the matter, this louing affection wil direct him, to conſult what manner of dealing is likely to doe moſt good, (for al men are not able to beare alike) that after conſultation had, he may procede accordingly: alwayes reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bring, that what ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ſoeuer, either the thing it ſelfe or the diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:7047:96"/>
of the man ſhall require, yet it may appeare, that we ſeeke not to haue the man defamed, but the ſinne cured. If in this behalfe the matter ſhall be cleere, bothe in our conſcience and the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of thoſe who are accuſtomed to weigh things by the wiſdome of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word, it ſkilleth not though thoſe men holde them not contented, who would haue ſinne touched, in whoſe opinion the mildeſt proceeding againſt ſinne that can be, is too boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterous.</p>
            <p>To conclude this parte, let vs be well aduiſed that wee ſpeake not of the infirmities of our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, but with this affection and meaning, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they may be reclaymed, or others feared from offending in the like, while they ſhall learne the great daunger thereof: and that there be no want of loue in vs towarde our brethren, that ſhall ſett our tonges a worke that way, without meaning of any good either towarde him or them that heare vs.</p>
            <p>There is an other vice and miſchiefe of the tongue reproued in this commaundement: when the wordes or deedes of our neighbours are by the want of this loue wrou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g either into a ſenſe plaine diuerſe from their meaning, or elſe not ſo well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted as they might be taken, if they had found any indifferent iudge. It is an euil practiſe &amp; miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefous, (notwithſtanding it be common at this day) to bring a mans owne wordes againſt him, chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged into an other ſenſe, purpoſe and meaning, then euer the man had in vttering of them: which
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:7047:96"/>
is not onely vſuall in wordes taken from the mouth of the ſpeaker, but alſo in ſpeeches penned as plainly as may be. For what is more vſual with many, then to ſtand ſo vppon ſome one or fewe bare wordes of a ſtatute, bond, or obligation, that the meaning of the ſame ſhall be cleane altered, and the true intent and purpoſe of the lawe-maker, no longer ſought for? But as it did not acquire the Iewes of falſe wittneſſe-bearing againſt the Lord Ieſus, notwithſtanding they vſed ſome of his wordes, becauſe they had altered his meaning, (wringing his wordes to the building vpp of the temple at Hieruſalem within three dayes,<note place="margin">Matt. 26.6 62.</note> whiche he ment of the Temple of his bodie) no more ſhall it be able before GOD to diſcharge any man that he hath ſtood vpon ſome words of a ſtatute, or obligation, when his conſcience ſhal accuſe him that he hath ſwarued from the meaning and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe thereof. As for the dealings of thoſe men who are accuſtomed to expounde thoſe thinges into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worſt parte, which might haue a good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning if they were indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly weighed, or for ſome infirmitie ioyned with a good action doe diſgrace and diſcredite the whole, this commaundement muſt neceſſarily reproue them, when it condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth (as we haue heard before) the careleſſe blazing abroade of thinges altogether euil in them ſelues, charging vs with the couering of them by friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie and priuate admonition.</p>
            <p>If things altogether euil, muſt be cured with a god<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:7047:97"/>
and friendly couert of priuate admonition had for that purpoſe, thoſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which if they were wel weighed might be well taken, muſt finde more friendſhip at our hand, then to haue open outcryes made againſt them. Neither can it be lawfull for a Chriſtian, where ſome infirmitie or wante hath bene found with a good deed vnder prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred had therevnto, to worke the diſcredite of the whole, and in ſo doeing to vndermine the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip of God, plainely appearing therein. It is wonderful to ſee our corrupte nature, what poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon it vttereth in ſuch matters as theſe be. We ſhal ſee ſome men that are litle moued or touched with infirmities and faultes of their owne (whiche are not in parte, but wholy euil,) and yet for all that ſo boyling at theſe little, and as I may tearme them halfe euils of others, (for ſo they are in reſpect of their owne,) that a man would iudge them to be great zealous men, when as in deede they nouriſh monſters at home, and can well inough awaye with them: yea whiche more is, play and dallie with them.</p>
            <p>It were good in ſuch cauſes to practiſe firſte vpon a man him ſelfe, before he take libertie to go abroade: firſt to vſe ſome ſharpe dealing with his owne affections, to ſee how that wil work, before he ſhall miniſter ſo bitter medicines vnto others. For it is an intollerable thinge, that greate euils ſhould liue quietly at home, when little ones are ſo ſharpely reuenged abroade. It is ſtraunge that any manne ſhoulde play with ſome that is
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:7047:97"/>
growne to bee a monſter, and not to bee able to looke vpon it in the childhoode thereof, when it is nothing ſo deformed nor euill fauoured. Suche quarelling with euils not halfe formed in others, eſpecially when there is quietneſſe with many that be alreadie perfectly ſhapen at home, can not proceede of any ſound meaning or hatred againſt ſinne. We muſt remember the end why the Lord hath giuen vs a toung: which is, that wee ſhould mainteine loue and friendlineſſe, in communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the good things that lie hid in our harts &amp; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, by our ſpeach and talke one with an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Wherefore wee muſt carefully conſider, that we vtter no poyſon nor venome that lurketh in our corrupt nature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and is deepely rooted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, by our toung and talke one with an other. The holy ghoſt being priuie to our great infirmitie this way, hath in many wordes forewarned vs of the ſlipperineſſe of the toung, that wee ſhould haue it vnder ſure and ſafe cuſtodie, telling vs in playne wordes, that hee, who ſhall let his lippes goe at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie without reſtraint, ſhall ſurely come to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, according as we are taught in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbs: <hi>He that keepeth his mouth, keepeth his life:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pro. 13.3.</note> 
               <hi>but he that letteth looſe his lippes, destruction ſhal be vnto him.</hi> And further: the good man is deſcribed to be mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and meditating what to ſpeake, and the foliſh and euil ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> without any moderation of that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, to be babbling out whatſoeuer firſt commeth into his head.<note place="margin">Pro. 15.28.</note> 
               <hi>The heart of the righteous ſtudieth to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere: but the wicked mans mouth babbleth euill things.</hi>
               <pb n="178" facs="tcp:7047:98"/>
In this place we ſee that the holy Ghoſt aſcribeth only a mouth vnto the fooliſh man, and not a hart to ponder and conſider his wordes before, which hart he giueth vnto the wiſe man, occupying it ſelf in muſing and conſidering how to ſpeake.<note place="margin">Pro. 15.2</note> In the ſame chapter there is yet a clearer and playner dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwene the wicked and the godly, drawn from their vſage in ſpeach, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the good man hauing wiſdome, and therfore good matter to vtter, doth notwithſtanding beautifie &amp; adorne it in entering the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideration how to make it good, &amp; get grace &amp; fauour vnto it, by obſeruing the circumſtances of fit time, place, and manner of vttering, whiche moſt may commend it: whereas the wicked and fooliſh man hath neither care of the matter whiche he is to vtter, neyther yet of the maner how to vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it. This vſe and end of the toung, to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the good thinges of our heart one with an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to the increaſe of loue and friendſhip among men, doth reproue thoſe who are wont to preſſe vpon others with wordes of wrath and contempt. It ſhall not excuſe him that hath layde reproch or contempt vpon his neighbour in his ſpeach, to ſay that his wordes were no wordes of malice, but of pleaſure and myrth: for euen that pleaſant ſpeache that nippeth and taunteth oure neighbour, and bringeth reproch, contempt, or griefe of heart vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, can neuer be ſo cloaked with the outward ſhewe of ieſting ſpeache, but that the Lorde ſhall clearely ſee the bitter griefe of contempt or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine that lyeth cloſe within it, and howe farre
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:7047:98"/>
that toung is from the maintenaunce of that loue and amitie, which increaſeth the eſtimation and credite of his neighbour.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, if the vſe of the toung bee to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate the good thinges of the heart, not onely theſe infamous ſpeaches ſhall be brought to iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but alſo fruitleſſe and vnſauourie words, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> haue not the fruite and profite of wholſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction in them. As we are taught by the apoſtle.<note place="margin">Ephe. 4.29</note> Epheſians: that we ſhould let no vnſauourie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication proceede out of our mouth, but that which may bring grace vnto the hearers. For (as we haue heard) the tong ſerueth to communicate together the good things of our heart, not the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe or vanitie that lurketh therin: and wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of there is ſo great daunger, that we are counſelled in the ſcripture to ſeparate our ſelues from fooliſh men,<note place="margin">Pro. 14.7</note> when wee perceiue not in them the lippes of knowledge.</p>
            <p>It is apparant by this that hath beene ſpoken, what are the dueties and good works of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, euen the contrarie of theſe aforena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. It ſhall be therefore ſufficient in a worde to touch them here, bycauſe they are clearely percey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in their contraries, whiche nowe wee haue heard reproued and forbidden in this commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The general charge of this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is, by loue to mainteine and vpholde the credite, eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and good name of our brother. For our loue muſt be declared as well by louing and entire deling with his credit, honor, &amp; good report, as by
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:7047:99"/>
louing behauiour towardes his goods and perſon. It behooueth therefore that the loue which wee beare towarde our brethren ſhould bee fruitfull in the good workes of this commandement, bicauſe this way the inward affection of the hart hath her outgoing, and is conuict either of loue or hatred, no leſſe than in his perſon and goods.</p>
            <p>As falſe witneſſe, ſtanding againſt the life and bloud of our neighbour, was the thing whiche in the firſt place (as we haue heard) was forbidden, ſo the good worke contrarie to this, is to vſe the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite of our teſtimonie for the defence of him. The goodneſſe of ſuch a worke is declared in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbes in theſe wordes: <hi>A faithfull witneſſe deliuereth ſoules.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pro. 14.25</note> What worke can be of greater account then to come iuſtly into this commendation, to haue deliuered the liues of men?

            <p>It was forbidden as a ſinne againſte this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, to blaze abroade the infirmities of our brethren.

although we would not wiſhe it before his death: being a long time holden in theſe thoughtes, and vaniſhing in theſe deſires, although nothing be ful<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly concluded to ſay deliberately in our heartes, Theſe pleaſures will we followe, are we not iuſtly blamed for not louing him with all our thoughts? Were it not a plaine mockerie of GOD, if a man ſhould giue libertie to his thoughts to purſue plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures whole dayes and weekes, ſo that they take heede of ſetting it downe, and concluding fully to wallowe in any? Our thoughts ſhould be wholy taken vp to the Lords vſe, and therefore may they not be let looſe after goods or benefites of our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, with the alone charge to take heede howe they fully ſettle them ſelues in them, but ſo they be ſure of that, otherwiſe to take no great care, this is not by loue to take vp our thoughts and direct them to his ſeruice, but by carnall libertie to giue them the head. And ſurely we may diſcerne a fault in this, euen by the light almoſt of reaſon: that our thoughts ſhould rather delight to ſpend themſelues vpon euill or vaine thinges, then vpon thoſe that haue the greateſt pleaſure and chiefeſt goodneſſe in them. Behold then it is a faultie thing that our thoughts run rouing after vaine things, that they folow the delights of their neighbours pleaſure or profites, though not greatly ſetled in them, but wantonly wandring by them. Why ſhould they not bee faſtened with delight and whole conſent vnto good things? Hath not the Lord payde the price for body and ſoule and al that is in vs? Why
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:7047:101"/>
then ſhould not all bee kept vnder his obedience, without rouing after our owne deſire? Either elſe why ſhould wee excuſe any thought ſtraying and wandring from him with this anſwere, that it had returned before it was gone ſo farre as poſsible it might? This is no reaſonable excuſe nor plaine dealing before our God: this is not to loue him with all the thought.

This were an intollerable thing among men. And can we thinke when we ſhall haue delighted oure ſelues a long time in the pleaſure of vnlawfull thoughtes, that this wil wipe out all, bicauſe we are not fully purpoſed to dwell in them? Our thoughts are married already vnto the Lorde: they are not at libertie to matche them ſelues where it ſhall beſt like them, neyther yet to acquaint them with any ſtraunge loue.

               </note> It is written to the Corinthians that loue thinketh not euill againſt him whome it loueth, nor reioyceth not in iniquitie done againſt him whom it tendreth. If then we ſhall loue our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, our thoughts muſt bee kept vp from think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any euill, or by thought intending any wrong againſt them. For the thoughts of a man that truly
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:7047:102"/>
loueth an other, imagineth nothing that hee kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth may hurt him, and therefore he is further fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> reioycing and delighting in it. No man can denie, but that we doe owe loue vnto our neighbours: therfore may not our thoughts haue libertie by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe and deſire, to hurt, harme, or hinder them: in wiſhing their delightes and comforts from them, or wiſhing our vſe of them, which can not be but with the vexing or annoying of them. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuch things abou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, it ſhal be proued that loue is not true in vs: for loue thinketh not euill, neyther reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth it in iniquitie: behold how we are ſent for tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of our loue towards our neighbours, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to our thoughts.</p>
            <p>It is a common ſaying, that thoughtes are free, that they pay no tribute any where: and it is true among men, they anſwere not in any court. But the Lorde God requireth tribute of them, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rayneth them, maketh the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hold vp their hand at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> barre, kepeth a court for them, and ſetteth fines and amerceaments vpon the heads of them: wherin, his court hath the prerogatiue and preeminence aboue all other. For bare thoughts feare not earthly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates: but the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly iudge, who ſearcheth the hart which can not be ſounded by man, bindeth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen the thoughtes vnto obedience, and exacteth dutifull obedience from them, whiche they ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may nor can, by any ſhewe of righte with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold him.</p>
            <p>This matter requireth ſome plainer ſpech to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the cleare ſight of it. Sometime our thoughts
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:7047:102"/>
ſhal be wandering this way and that way, and yet the deſire not ſtyrred to hearken after them, or to be ſet aflote with them: euen then is mater offered, to humble our ſelues. For why ſhuld not our tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ughts keepe them ſtayedly vpon good things, and ſtand vnto their dutifull ſeruice? And though the Lord be content to beare with vs when there is no deſire or longing appetite, why ſhould not wee bee grieued, that any thing in vs ſhould make ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny eſcapes from the Lorde, and ſo many attempts to giue him the ſlip? This hath in it matter of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liking, that there ſhould be any ſuch vntowardnes in vs, and that our thoughts ſhuld be ſo vnruly, as euer and anon they are to bee called home to giue their attendance. This ſurely ought to humble vs euen in this reſpect.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, theſe thoughtes are not only out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraying them ſelues, but alſo ſoliciting and allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring our deſires and affections to rebel with them: This alſo can not but make vs humble, careful, and watchfull. Remember then, where no deſire doth ioyne with the thoughts of our mynd, yet is there occaſion why ſuch thoughts ſhuld be miſliked of, and we euen to be wearied with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and vexed at them: deſiring after a godly and patient manner to haue this tickle and vnſtable eſtate chaunged with that, which ſhall abide free fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theſe pricking pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocations vnto euils: according to the example of the apoſtle, who notwithſtanding he had maruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly profited in al obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, &amp; maruellouſly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayled in keeping his conſent from euil, ſo that he

Miſerable therefore is that religion of Rome, that telleth a man there is no care to bee had of thoughts, ſo that our deſire doe not with ful and ſetled affection followe after them and bathe her ſelfe in them. Sometimes our concupiſcence and coueting thoughts, get the deſire and affection of our will to hearken vnto them for ſometime, and to conferre with them: which deſire and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our will (after ſome better aduiſement ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken) letteth them goe, and yealdeth not any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to ioyne wholy with them: this is a degree worſſe then the other, and therefore more to bee miſliked: yet notwithſtanding the conſent is not ſetled, without the which the Papiſtes and that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of Rome ſay that the matter is a matter of nothing, nothing to bee weyghed or eſteemed of. In this kynde, ſometimes wee beate backe ſuche tentations verie ſoone, when our deſire hath bene but a little while with them, hauing had verie litle liking of them or conference with them. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times againe, after ſome long time of conference had, ſtanding in a mammering what to do, (ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times liking well to go with them, and reaſoning for them, and anon conceiuing ſomething to the contrarie,) at the laſt with muche wraſtling and much adoe, we wring our ſelues out of the handes
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:7047:103"/>
of them: here is not yet their full conſent. But what the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is not the occaſion doubled, why we ſhuld be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile our weakneſſe and lament our pouertie, that ſtand in ſo great daunger, to become euen ſlaues vnto ſinne, and to ioyne wholy with it? Is there not cauſe though it be pardoned, that yet it ſhould be acknowledged faultie as it is? and his mercy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great in working our riddance from ſuch a dangerous ſnare, wherein we had intangled our ſelues with ſo great peril as that was? and alſo our owne too eaſie inclination thervnto is to be pitied, bewailed, and confeſſed of vs, yea, and with feruent prayer ſo much the more to be holpen. For in ſuch luſts there needed but one blaſt more, and we had ben wholy carried with it, and the conception had ben perfect, ſo that we could not haue auoyded af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this conceiuing, but haue nouriſhed that mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter whatſoeuer, vntill it had bene brought forth: for concupiſcence after conception bringeth forth ſinne.<note place="margin">Iames. 1.15</note> The daunger then is great for our deſire to haue any familiaritie, yea, but a time with thoſe thoughts. For if it goe hand in hand with them, there is daunger of ſuche aioyning with them, as it ſhall conceiue thereof, and nouriſhe that mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous ſeede, vntil it come forth a mightie &amp; huge monſter. This is the cauſe why the Apoſtle war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth vs to take heede, leaſt ſuche deſires make any abode with vs, and be ſuffered any time to reſt vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vs, leaſt we conceiue by them, and ſo afterward willingly and wittingly nouriſh them, vntill they come to light. In the ſame conſideration wee
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:7047:104"/>
are warned in the Epiſtle to the Epheſians,<note place="margin">Ephe. 4.26</note> that the ſunne ſhould not go downe vpon our wrath: that we ſhould not ſleepe with thoſe paſsions, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer our ſelues to continue in them any time vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled and not driuen backe, leaſt vnhappily wee ſhould conceiue of the comming and continuing together, that miſchief, which being once concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, it ſhall not grieue vs to nouriſh, be it neuer ſo ougly and monſtrous in the eyes of others.</p>
            <p>What ſhall we ſay then to thoſe teachers, that ſay there is no daunger nor feare, ſaue when con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception is perfected, and the will hath wholy rele<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and is with delight ſet downe in it? Can there be any conference about the begetting of ſuche monſters, that ſhall not haue great blame iuſtly layde vnto it? Can thoughts that are married vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord, euer approch vnto the bed of ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, and not bee conuict of faith and fidelitie bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with the Lord him ſelfe? Can ſhe any longer be accounted chaſte, that admitteth conference of long continuaunce, about the enterteinment of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers beſides her lawfull husband? Yet would the Papiſtes haue ſuch blameleſſe: howe often ſoeuer they haue ſuch vnchaſte and vngodly meeting, if by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiuing and fully conſenting they bring not foorth ſinne.<note place="margin">Pſal. 4.5.</note> The counſel that is giuen vs by the Prophete Dauid is farre otherwiſe, whervnto no doubt the apoſtle did allude in the place before al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged out of the epiſtle to the Epheſians, for there we are charged, that we ſhould ſhake at ſuch thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and not perſeuere in them, but deale earneſtly
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:7047:104"/>
with our heart againſt them in our chamber, and not ſuffer ſuch continuance in meeting, nor conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall meeting, whereby this monſtrous byrth and conception might iuſtly be feared. There is then occaſion offered to ſtand vpon our watche, and to ſtrengthen our affections againſt ſuche co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueting deſires, whenſoeuer they ariſe, leaſt this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence by long dallying with our affections, at length get within them, and ſo ouerthrowe them.</p>
            <p>The infection of ſinne is ſo vniuerſally diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ouer our nature, that there is no part free from it: for it hath entred and infected the thoughts the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues, and they are poyſoned with it, ſo that there is deadly daunger in following and perſuing after the will of our owne thoughts. The Apoſtle Paule when he ſetteth foorth the fearefull eſtate that hee was in before his conuerſion, &amp; which all men are in by nature, (for he putteth him ſelfe in the ranke with others) ſpeaketh no otherwiſe of it but thus, That he followed the will of his owne fleſh and of his owne thoughts.<note place="margin">Ephe. 2.3.</note> No other guide had hee but run after the direction of his owne thoughts, euen then whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his eſtate was moſt da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nable. We muſt therfore learne to ſuſpect our thoghts, if we wil be aduiſed by the Apoſtle, and not to imagine with the doctours of Rome that our eſtate is good, ſo long as the will (when it ſhall haue wraſtled) at length getteth out, not hauing wholy yealded nor flatly falne downe. Thoughts therfore ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning this way after any thing of our neighbors, in ſo doing, make manifeſt declaration of their poyſon &amp; cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: which if they ſhal haue no reſiſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, do carie
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:7047:105"/>
vs headlong through the broad way, into deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. If by grace they ſhall be ſtopped and reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, in that grace, God is to be magnified: yet we in that our corruption notwithſtanding iuſtly are to be blamed and admoniſhed, therby to ſeeke for more ayde in that part of our thoughtes, leaſt if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tentation ſhould lye ſore vpon vs, ſathan ſhoulde that way get entrance into the heart. It ſeemeth a hard doctrine, that thoughts, wiſhes, and deſires ſhould be condemned, that lawes ſhould bee made for them, and men charged with the ordering of them: and no maruel if it appeare ſo vnto vs, for it appeareth that the apoſtle Paule wold neuer haue ſuſpected any danger in concupiſcence, luſtes, and deſires, if the lawe had not ſayde, <hi>Thou ſhalt not lust or deſire.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 7.7.</note> Nay, it appeareth plainely in that place, that hee thought maruellous well of him ſelfe, before he came to this commandement. He tooke him ſelf before to be liuing and in good liking to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God and godlineſſe: but (as he confeſſeth) after he had looked vpon this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement, and beheld him ſelfe a while in this part of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> glaſſe, he ſawe him ſelfe plainly to be no body, a dead man, ſold vnto ſinne. Howe neceſſarie then is it to ſift our ſelues, &amp; to examine vs in this commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t throughly, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we may be humbled vnder the grace of God as apperteineth? For if he ſo ſingular a man was not throughly caſt down before he had wraſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> iuſtice of god in this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, how requiſite is it y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we ſhuld truly trie vs here, leaſt y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in ſuppoſing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> to be in vs which we want, we becom

careleſſe in ſeeking the mercie of Chriſt, without the which there is no hope.</p>
            <p>In this commaundement therefore aboue all the reſt, it is required that wee be diligent and true tryers of our ſelues. For thoſe who haue no miſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of them ſelues, for the luſting and coueting after the thinges of their neighbours, whiche they doe perceiue to be in their thoughts, haue no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianitie in them to be accounted of. Euill beeing miſliked in trueth, will be miſliked whereſoeuer it ſhall be, whether in worde, thought or deede. Euil being truly reſiſted, wil be reſiſted eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in thought: and therfore certein it is, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he who neuer hath ſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with euil in his thoughts, hath neuer truly ſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen with ſinne. It was meete y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the law ſhould vtter all our euil, and hide nothing of our vnrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe from vs, that the manifolde corruption ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of might force vs to ſeke the mediatour and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker Chriſt: that we beeing ſo many wayes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uicted of corruption in our ſelues, might wholy giue ouer the opinion of our owne workes and meriting, and ſo make much of the mercie offered by Ieſus Chriſte: which is ſo muche the more made of, by how much we doe more cleerely ſee our vtter vndoeing without it.</p>
            <p>If onely the acte of murther, adulterie, thefte, and falſe wittneſſe-bearing, or the deliberate and ſetled conſent vnto any of thoſe, ſhould alone come in queſtion in the cauſe and matter of ſinne againſt our neighbour, many an euil man would hope to make good ſhifte: but when thoughts and
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:7047:106"/>
deſires vnto any of thoſe, are called for and exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, it will cauſe any man to caſt downe his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and to fall a pleading of his pardon.</p>
            <p>As before, we were endaungered by the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of Rome, to conceiue ſinne, when they not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding bad vs liue without any feare (in that reſpect) of ſinne, ſo long as we keepe our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent cleare in the matter: So here (if we ſhall hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to their doctrine) we come in daunger neuer to magnifie rightly the mercyes brought vs by Chriſt Ieſus: while we ſee not halfe the neede that we haue of him, nor y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> halfe parte of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> miſerie that we are in without him. For a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may make good ſhifts, if onely deedes and full conſents be aſked af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſo in his owne iudgement no great bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite is obteyned by him that ſhall ſupply that whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che is lacking in his behalfe, and therefore he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth no greate haſte to ſeeke after him. But when thoughts &amp; deſires are ſifted, he muſt of neceſſitie acknowledge him ſelfe greately befriended, if ſo great want of his ſhal by an other be found anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. We muſt looke in this glaſſe of the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, and into this infinite nature of luſt, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, and concupiſcence, that we may be confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in our ſelues vtterly, that our deliuerie may be from the gates of death, that we may knowe how that our ſaluation conſiſteth in his meere grace: for we can hardly be brought to begge abrode, till all reliefe be ſpent at home.</p>
            <p>There is no daunger in the feeling and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeing of our pouertie: for the Lord hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:7047:106"/>
that if thoſe that be heauie loaden with ſin ſhall come vnto him, they ſhall be refreſhed:<note place="margin">Matth. 11.</note> neither was there euer found any that deſpayred, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had not thought too well of him ſelfe. All the daunger is on the other ſide, leaſt wee not taking thoſe to be no ſinnes which are ſinnes in deed, &amp; ſo thinking better of our ſelues then there is cauſe, ſhould in iuſtice be iudged of the Lord,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11.</note> becauſe we would not proceede by a right rule to iudge our ſelues.</p>
            <p>By this that wee haue heard, it is plaine, that a Chriſtian muſt walke in feare and care, not onely to conſent to euil towards his neighbour, but alſo to be ſtirred and pricked with any, bee it neuer ſo little or ſmall a delight therevnto: and that our thoughts are poyſoned, and therefore the daunger great in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> not bridling of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The thing then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded, is, to bring our deſires, thoughts, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights vnto the good and benefite of our brethren, in matters wherein they are to be benefited: that we bring not only hands to do wel to our neighbours, but alſo heartes, thoughts, deſires, luſting, longing, and delighting therein,<note place="margin">Rom. 7.22.</note> according as the apoſtle te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifieth of him ſelfe, that he was delighted with the law of God according to the inner man: whervnto accordeth the holie Ghoſt in the Prouerbs in theſe wordes: <hi>It is ioy to the iuſt to doe iudgement.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pro. 21.15.</note> Many haue bene brought to do outward things in them ſelues good, which neuer had any ioyfull deſire in them to glorifie God with them: but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holie ghoſt worketh in his, not onely a chaunge of workes,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:7047:107"/>
but alſo an alteration of thoughtes, deſires and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, that their deſires may be holden within that whiche is good. Wherin it behoueth a Chriſtian to be carefull, euen thus to transforme his delights: not taking it ſufficient, if hee ſhall haue brought them at any time from that which was euill, vntill he haue ioyned them to that which is good. Let our care be increaſed this way, to haue ſuche de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and delight vnto that whiche is good, as may reteine our thoughts and kepe them diligently oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied in ſuche ſeruices. Be it far from vs to think that the grace of GOD onely reacheth vnto the deede and ful conſent, letting deſires and thoughts take their libertie in their corruption. We muſte confeſſe (as the trueth is) that his grace not onely bridleth thoughts fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ruſhing into y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which is euil, but alſo giueth them a ſweete taſte in that which is good, and holdeth them greatly therevnto. There is no man will denie, but that we ought to delight in that which is good: and ſurely if the delight be once taken in doing good vnto our neighbour, it will gather the thoughtes together, and aſſemble them to that ioy &amp; delight. If when the delight is wicked, the thoughtes are ſpent therevppon, ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if the deſire bee chaunged, the thoughts alſo wil reſorte greately thither. Let vs therefore ſeeke after the grace of GOD, not onely to ſeaſon our deeds, but alſo our thoughts &amp; delights therewith, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> our ſtudie and thoughts may be occupied in that which is acceptable to him. For if ſome deeds ſhal at ſtarts be done of vs, but the heart neuertheleſſe

vnchaunged in deſires &amp; delights, it ſhall not profit vs. The vnderſtanding that Chriſtians haue of their eſtate, how it fareth betwene God and them, is better taken, and hath ſurer profe and more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne teſtimonie from their deſires and inwarde affections vnto the lawe of GOD, then from their outwarde doeing of things commaunded by the lawe. Euil things may be left vndone for feare of puniſhment, for deſire of commendation, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyding of euill ſpeech, or for that wee are not tempted with them, when notwithſtanding the heart ſhall not in any reſpect miſlike of them.</p>
            <p>Good things alſo may bee done for praiſe of man, for hope of merites with God, when yet the affection ſhall nothing bee moued that way. And this is nothing before God, to auoyde euill from thy hand, but to embrace it neuertheleſſe in thy heart, or to doe good with thy hand without any deſire of the heart. So that bothe in euill deedes left vndone, and alſo in good deedes done, we may be deceiued.</p>
            <p>But if the inwarde affection of the heart ſtand deſireouſly affected after that which GOD hath commaunded vs to doe vnto men, and hateful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affected towardes that which God hath forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, this chaunge cannot be wrought there, but by the ſpirite of GOD alone. As for the praiſe or diſpraiſe of the people, it reacheth nothing ſo farr. Let vs then embrace this deſire vnto the dueties commaunded vs, not giueing any reſt vnto the Lorde in our prayers before we ſhall obteine this
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:7047:108"/>
inwarde teſtimonie whiche is aboue all excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be taken againſt it:<note place="margin">Eſaie. 62.</note> and without the which outwarde doeinges are of no account before the Lord, who looketh into the affections of man, and embraceth a cherefull and delightfull giuer.</p>
            <p>Heere are thoſe men confuted that would driue affections out of the fleaſhe, and kil nature, attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſuch things as vtterly tend to deſtroy it: as if the nature of man ſhuld by regeneration beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> nature of Angels: wheras regeneration killeth not nature, but reſtoreth and repayreth it: deſtroyeth not the affections, but tranſfourmeth them from that euill which naturally they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined vnto, into that which is good &amp; commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of GOD.</p>
            <p>The angrie man may not thinke his conuerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and regeneration to be good, if hee ſhall bende him ſelfe neuer to be moued with any thing at all: but if that heate which ſometimes hee felte vnto euill, be now as feruent vnto that whiche is good, then is his conuerſion approued before GOD. The couetous man is not then conuerted, when he ſhall haue driuen all deſire &amp; thirſt after world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commodities out of his minde, vnleſſe that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire be repaired in him, to beſtowe and vſe thoſe commodities as GOD hath commaunded.

            <p>In all theſe dueties towarde our neighbours, we may neuer forget this which hath partely bene touched before: that if it were poſſible for vs to perfourme all dueties vnto men, and yet not doe them in obedience vnto God, according vnto the rules which before we haue learned, it were vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be abhorred.

            <p>Let vs learne throughly to examine our thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghtes, not onely blaming thoſe that fully conſent, but euen warring with thoſe that any whit de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light them ſelues in coueting and deſiring that whiche apperteyneth vnto others: ſo ſhall wee ſee whether it bee an eaſie matter to loue our neighboure as our ſelfe, or otherwiſe: ſo ſhall we alſo clearely giue ouer the title of righteouſneſſe in regarde of our owne doinges, and wholy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend vpon the free merites of God in Chriſt, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding in the confidence thereof, with good cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to purifie our thoughts, that we may not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do good with the hand, but euen with the long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſire of our thoughts.

The properties &amp; fruits of loue, are in no place better ſet foorth then in the former Epiſtle to the Corinthes:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 13.4.</note> from whence I meane to giue you ſome light, thereby the better to ſee into loue, the nature of it, and howe great thinges are conteyned in it. Where the firſt note giuen to knowe it by, is that it <hi>ſuffereth long,</hi> or is patient: a propertie that moderateth the heate and haſtineſſe of a mans minde, that he followe it not, in the boyling ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite and deſire thereof. This patience and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of our affections, hathe great commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the ſcripture: eſpecially the booke of the Prouerbes painteth foorth the excellencie thereof in ſo many places, and with ſo great titles, as I can not but giue you a taſte of ſome of them. In the foureteenth Chapter of that booke, it is thus writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten: <hi>He that is ſtowe to wrath is of great wiſedome,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prou. 14.29</note> 
               <hi>but he that is of an haſtie minde,</hi> (or to giue it you as it is there word for word, he that is of a ſhort ſpirite,) <hi>exalteth follie.</hi> In this place we ſee this ſloweneſſe vnto wrath is not barely ioyned with wiſedome, but with the excellencie of wiſedome. For ſo it is ſaid, He is of great wiſedome that is ſlowe vnto wrathe.</p>
            <p>It is a degree and profiting in wiſdome, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che not all men, no, not all wiſemen haue atteyned vnto, to moderate the headie and haſtie affection of an angrie and paſſionate minde. Likewiſe in the ſame booke thus ſpeaketh the holy Ghoſt: <hi>The diſcretion of a man differreth his anger: and his glorie is to paſſe by an offence.</hi> A merueilous commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:7047:110"/>
that it ſhould be the glorie of a man to put vppe offences: that he ſhould haue no manhode in him, or matter to boaſt of any thing worthie of a man, that hath not learned to paſſe by offences, and to qualifie his affections, euen towardes tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and iniuries. Nature teacheth vs a cleane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie leſſon: that it is the glorie and zeale of a man to perſue the infirmities of others, and reuenge our affections the heate and diſpleaſure of them therevpon: and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he is a beaſt &amp; no man, that wil let go wronges, tranſgreſſions, and iniuries vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenged, eſpecially, if they ſhall haue touched him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. But the ſpirite of God teacheth vs, that it is loue that findeth a waye to cure a tranſgreſſion, &amp; yet notwithſtanding to couer it, and to reſerue a place to couer it, vntil it ſhalbe cured, as it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in this booke.</p>

               <note place="margin">Pro. 10.12.

               <note place="margin">Pro. 29.28.</note>In a nother place of this booke, the holy Ghoſt compareth that man that can not reſtraine his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, vnto a citie broken downe, and without walles: but I muſt conteine my ſelfe within theſe
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:7047:110"/>
fewe teſtimonies for that purpoſe: for it were a verie great labour to ſeeke out all that is ſpoken hereof, if I ſhould goe no further then vnto this booke. This patience and long ſuffering, being as we haue heard ſo excellent, euen y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> glorie of a man, may iuſtly clame the firſt place among the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of loue. For what can be more fitte to vpholde loue, then to be of a patient ſpirite, when matter is offered &amp; occaſion, to breake loue and heartie good affection? He doth iuſtly deſerue wel of loue, &amp; to haue his praiſe in all the fruits that followe it, who ſhal by patience vnderprop it, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it ſhalbe aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and ſhaken by hatred or euill dealing howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer. As for that man, who then letteth loue fall downe, whenſoeuer any burthen of diſpleaſure, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, or vnkinde dealing ſhalbe laide vppon him from the man whome he pretended to loue, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth plainely, that he neuer taſted of true loue, and heartie affection, the firſt and principall note whereof is to be patient and ſuffer long. Let him ceaſſe therefore to make any account of his loue, who hath not made reckoning to vpholde it in iniuries and diſpleaſures. And let him alſo ceaſſe to bragge of any loue that he hathe borne vnto a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, who neuer was tried to haue mainteined it, throughe the vncourteous dealing of that man in one reſpect or other. For who is he (if he be not a monſter of men) that cannot liue peaceably with them who neuer ſhal diſpleaſe him? But then is it thankeſworthie, when our loue by patience ſhal o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome the vnkindeneſſe of others.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="204" facs="tcp:7047:111"/>This note of loue is clearely ſeene in that loue, whiche mothers beare to their children: howe muche frowardneſſe and cauſeleſſe crying doe the mothers not onely patiently beare at the hande of the childe by loue, but alſo appeaſe, not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then by giuing of them ſomething to quiet them withall, by loue rewarding rather then reuenging their frowardneſſe. There is loue, and therefore the chiefe propertie thereof can not bee wanting, whiche is to be patient and long ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.</p>
            <p>The litle bearing and forbearing one of an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bothe publiquely and priuately, doeth plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpeake, that loue is not to be found in the nature of man, but is an eſpeciall gift of God. For ſo ſicke are we of ſelfe-loue, and ſo voide of the loue of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that not onely we cannot paſſe by the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of our brother, and by a louing hyding of the ſame cure it, but alſo we can hardly abide, that any ſhould in any thing (thoughe not euill) either in opinion or affection be diuided from vs. Nay, whiche more is, oftentimes we woulde haue all our friendes beare an heauie countenaunce towards him, whom we for priuate cauſes haue begone to miſlike. But true loue is patient and ſuffereth long, forgiuing others, euen as God for Chriſte his ſake hathe forgiuen vs.<note place="margin">Ephe. 4.32.</note> Neither is there any thing in vs worthie of praiſe in this worke of loue, if this pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and long ſuffering be abſent.</p>
            <p>For aſmuche therefore as bothe there hath bene &amp; ſhalbe alſo vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end of the world in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> children
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:7047:111"/>
of God weakeneſſe and wantes bothe in iudgment and in affection, it is moſte neceſſarie for him that ſhall haue dealing with any whatſoeuer, to craue earneſtly at the handes of God for this excellent ſtay of loue, which is called patience or long ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, without the which it wilbe impoſſible to liue Chriſtianly in any ſocietie howe ſmall ſo euer: eſpecially is this gifte neceſſarie in theſe latter dayes, where all places and perſons almoſte are full of offence.</p>
            <p>It is to be obſerued, that this propertie of loue is not onely at variance with haſtineſſe that is ſo ſoone diſpleaſed and ſo eaſily offended, but alſo with that other extremitie, when a man is ſo ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed with diſpleaſure conceiued, as that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding hee burſt not out into heate, yet he ſuffereth his affection towardes the man alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to quenche in him, ceaſſing any more to ſhewe forth the fruites of a louing heart. Therfore in fewe wordes to comprehend the nature of this propertie of loue, it is that good affection whiche paſſeth through vnkindeneſſe to vtter it ſelfe, and breaketh through diſpleaſures to make it ſelf kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen by louing deeds, being in verie deed the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and work of God, and therfore able ſo ſtrongly againſt ſuche ſtrong lets, to preuaile.<note place="margin">The ſecond propertie of loue.</note> It is alſo ſaid of this loue, that it is <hi>Bountifull,</hi> a ſecond note or ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecte to diſcerne it by. The worde ſignifieth him that is courteous, gentle, and readie to pleaſure an other, whiche is rather the cauſe of bountifulneſſe, then bountifullneſſe it ſelfe. For when the heart
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:7047:112"/>
ſtandeth ſo ſweetely affected, it cannot eaſily be let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from plentifull witneſſing of the ſame, as occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and abilitie will permitte. That this is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie that cannot be ſundered from loue, it doeth appeare in the loue and affection whiche parentes beare vnto their children. How gentle are they to them, howe readie to ſeeke the pleaſuring of them, howe plentifull and liberall therein? Which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth wholy of a tender affection towards them. This fruite of loue is fitly ioyned vnto the other: for when a man can not onely beare the diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures &amp; vnkindneſſe of men, but alſo is of a gentle &amp; franke diſpoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, readie to deſerue wel of men, howe can there be any thing more required? For his patient ſpirite wil not eaſily take offence at the euil dealinges of others, and his mylde affection will as hardely vſe euill dealing towardes ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Therefore peace is ſoone purchaſed and long continued, where there is plentie and ſtore of ſuche affections. Euerie man may ſee how hard a thing it is to finde either of theſe fruites of loue. For where is that man almoſte to bee found, that will beare any vnkindeneſſe at the handes of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Or where is that gentle diſpoſition, that hath a grace and facilitie in readineſſe to doe well vnto another? If any ſhal haue obteined the one, he thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it therefore almoſte an vnlawfull thing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt the other at his handes.</p>
            <p>For if he be a man that can beare ſomewhat with the vntowardneſſe of others, he taketh the
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:7047:112"/>
deſert thereof to be ſo great, as that it were not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to looke for any courteous dealing from him, but to holde them ſelues well ſatiſfied with that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: ſo as euen that were to be vnthankfull for it, if they did but ſeeme to require any thing to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded more vnto it. Likewiſe, if any be founde of a gentle and readie affection to pleaſure others, he thinketh his ſo doing, to carrie with it a diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and priuilege for his not bearing of vnkinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe at the handes of others: ſo harde a thing is it to match theſe two together. But how hard ſoeuer it be to find theſe two coupled together in any one, yet this is an aſſured trueth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> whereſoeuer loue is, there are apparant tokens of them bothe. There is bothe patience towardes infirmities, and readineſſe to deſerue wel of thoſe howe many ſoeuer we ſhal loue.</p>
            <p>It is lamentable to conſider, howe farre the dealings of men ſwarue from theſe properties. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie man ſaith, he is in loue and charitie with al men: yet if he ſhall neuer ſo litle be offended, he cannot be kept either from plaine reuenging, or at the leaſt from letting go al good liking of the man. And as he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be kept from reuenging, no more can he be dragged and haled to well deſeruing of any: yet for al this perſuadeth he himſelfe, that al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> loue and charitie that is required in a man, doeth dwel plentifully in him: ſo vnſkilfully &amp; vnchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably do we iudge of loue and charitie, as if he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued a man, who were not prouoked by any affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on boiling in him to hate, or at leſt to miſlike him:
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:7047:113"/>
whereas in verie deede loue is a tender liking con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued of a man, and ſo greatly delighting &amp; affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of him, that it maketh him bothe merueilous apt and eaſie to doe whatſoeuer may pleaſure him, and alſo verie harde by any griefe or diſpleaſure to let goe the good liking that once he hathe concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of him. The worlde knoweth not this affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for it is the ſpeciall worke of Gods grace. It needeth no long ſpeeche to declare that the world is not acquainted with it: for euerie man almoſte is careleſſe in offending other, ſo farre is he from this affection that is ſo readie to pleaſure: and eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie man alſo is impatient of the leſt diſpleaſure that may be offered from any other. This that hath ben ſpoken of the rareneſſe of this affection which we cal loue, may not beget in vs a deſpaire to come by it, but a care earneſtly to ſeeke it where it may bee had, and wilbe had of ſo many as in the carefull deſire therof ſhal multiplie their petitions &amp; pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to God for it: which muſt be ſo much y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more feruent and often, as this age hathe moſte neede of it, and is fartheſt from acquaintance with it.</p>
            <p>This is alſo a note of loue to diſcerne it by, that it is not <hi>Enuious. Loue</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>enuieth not.</hi> This tender affection of loue that knitteth the hart of one vnto another, is ſo farre from enuying the graces or giftes of God whatſoeuer in any other whome he loueth, that he wiſheth from his heart, that they were more and better then they are. For tryall of the trueth herein, let vs conſider of the
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:7047:113"/>
affection of parents towards their children: where wee are ſure that nature hathe planted loue, and therefore this note of not enuying which alwayes accompanieth it, cannot be wanting there. What parentes were euer found (except it were ſome one rare monſter in nature) that did enuie their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, becauſe there were ſuche plentie or ſtore of giftes in them? Nay, we ſee the plaine contrarie, that they are greatly delighted to heare them prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of others for their giftes, and muche giuen to ſpeake of their praiſe themſelues: ſometime think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and affirming thoſe giftes which they haue, to be more and greater, then in deede they are: nay, ſometime imagining that to be in them in great meaſure, whereof in deede they neuer had any portion, no not the leaſt parte: ſo farre are they from any enuying of them: for by loue they are ſo as it were made one, that the praiſes of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren they take to be a part of their owne commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, whiche willingly they would not looſe.</p>
            <p>This loue doeth ſo ioyne together and vnite them, that there can nothing be taken from the one, but the other taketh him ſelfe to be maymed thereby: as if he had loſt ſome limme or ioynt of his owne. For this affection maketh them to growe both into one: and who hathe euer enui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the good or benefite that he receiued by ſome member of his owne bodie?</p>
            <p>The Scripture teacheth vs that we are all mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of one bodie, and that wee haue our parte
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:7047:114"/>
of the profit that commeth by the giftes of others, through the meruelous working of God. What maddeneſſe therefore were it to enuie our owne commoditie? There can be no greater token of an hatefull man, then is enuie: neither any playner profe that we are diuers from the bodie of Chriſt, then to enuie the giftes of the members thereof. There is great diuerſitie betweene loue and enuie, for he that loueth taketh himſelfe to be benefited in the benefite of him whome he loueth: him ſelfe to be praiſed, in the praiſes of that man whome he liketh.</p>
            <p>The enuious man on the contrarie parte, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth that another man is not praiſed, but in the ſelf ſame he is diſpraiſed: y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> another cannot be profi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame he is hindered: &amp; therfore ſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth when any thing is attributed to another, as if in that deede ſomthing had bene taken fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> himſelf. Thus in all thinges the enuious man dealeth as if he were a ſtranger from the other, the louing man as if he were not diuerſe, but one with the other, &amp; a verie part and member of the ſame. Let vs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore keepe our ſelues farre from this enuie, the tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt token that can be of the abſence of charitie, &amp; all true feare of God or fellowſhip with his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</p>
            <p>For the driuing away of enuie, we haue firſt to deale with our heartes, to perſuade them, (as the trueth is in deede) that we haue our benefite and profite in their giftes, no leſſe then the eye hathe benefite from the foote, or the foote from the eye:
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:7047:114"/>
which is brought to paſſe, by the ſecrete and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull working of God.</p>
            <p>Secondarily, that we are of one bodie, and that therfore we are intituled after a maner to the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, commodities, or benefits that doe redound vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that the Lorde is the authour of this diuerſitie in giftes, and that therefore the enuying of others for their giftes giuen vnto them, is in deede to picke a quarell with the Lorde who hath giuen it them, and to vtter our miſlyking of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution and diſpoſing of matters among men. And howe daungerous a thing it is to controll the lord, I leaue to them to conſider of at their leyſure. Laſt of al, to feede our affection herein, is to bring a continuall torment vpon vs. For when wil there ceaſſe to be diuerſitie of giftes in men? And if we be grieued when others haue that which we haue not, when ſhal we ceaſſe to be vexed? Shall there not be this diuerſitie vnto the ende? Shal there be any time when all the bodie ſhalbe but one member? Let vs not imagine y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> when we ſhal giue our harts leaue to enuie ſome one, that this affection will die when he is taken away, or when we ſhal haue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed againſt him: nay, it is made by y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> meanes ſo much y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more ſtronger: and as for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> occaſion, it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer dieth.</p>
            <p>For there ſhalbe alwayes ſome that ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue, and iuſtly haue true prayſe and eſtimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for ſome thing, whiche we haue not, and therefore cannot come to haue the praiſe of it for
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:7047:115"/>
our ſelues. In deede the nexte way to haue the glorie of it, is by loue to be one: as one with the true owner thereof.</p>
            <p>To incourage vs to this loue that driueth away enuie, let vs remember that in driuing it away we ioyne with the Lord, who hathe thus appointed it. We approue his doinges as good: we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge by thankefulneſſe the commoditie that we haue of them: we ridde our ſelues of an infinite and endeleſſe torment. To conclude this proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of loue: it is requiſite that we often conſider, howe vnworthie we are of thoſe benefites that we doe inioy, to learne, bothe to be contented with them, and to be thankfull to God for them, and to keepe vs in ſuche thankefull remembraunce there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as may make vs ſtudious to walke worthie of them, to ſo great goodneſſe of God towardes vs therein, as may keepe vs occupied in care, how by dueties we may aunſwere them: alwayes taking heede, leaſt we ſhould become vnthankfull, euen for the good whiche God did meane towardes vs in thoſe giftes, the poſſeſſion wherof he hath giuen vnto others.</p>
            <p>As loue is voide of enuie, ſo is it reported here by the holy Ghoſte that it is voide of dealing inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently, frowardly, or ſtubbernely, (for ſo ſoundeth the worde,) and that it is not puffed vp with pride againſte him whome he loueth. Moreouer, that it doeth no vncomely thing againſte him, without hauing due regarde of the dignitie of the man, his degree, eſtate, or condition whatſoeuer.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="213" facs="tcp:7047:115"/>Theſe thinges are expreſſed in three wordes in the text, and may be expreſſed in theſe three wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des thus: that loue dealeth not frowardly, proud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, nor vncomely. Theſe thinges doe I ioyne together in ſpeaking of them, becauſe they are of ſuch affinitie one with another. Where true loue is, there the man who loueth is ſo perſuaded of the excellencie of the other whome he loueth, and ſo rauiſhed with the admiration of ſome one or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing in him, that in his iudgemente there is nothing, no not in himſelfe like vnto it, or worthy of it: with the whiche hee is ſo delighted, and in loue withall, that often times he thinketh himſelfe happie, if the ſubmitting of himſelfe to any ſeruice or paynes for him, may be accepted of and taken in good worth at his handes. For the thing whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che he is in loue withal, appeareth ſo glorious in his eyes, that it darkeneth not only ſome litle thing in himſelf, but euen y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which is the beſt in him, and that whiche before he made moſte reckoning of, nowe being ſett by this whiche he is ſo inamou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with, appeareth ſcarſe ſufficiently worthie to ſerue it.</p>
            <p>A true proofe of this nature, that it is in loue, may be taken fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that prouerbe which is receiued among vs, whiche is: That loue and lordſhip can broke no fellowſhip. For loue magnifieth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which it loueth ſo greatly, that it can ſuffer none to be fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes with it at that worthineſſe whiche it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyueth thereof, but will haue all other with all ſubmiſſion to giue place therevnto. It was no
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:7047:116"/>
doubt long tried experience that brought this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a common ſpeeche, and we haue the triall of it in the loue that we beare towardes our ſelues. For our nature cannot like of ſuche a praiſe, wherein others are thought as good as we, hauing equall commendation with vs. We eſteeme it nothing if we be not magnified, as all others be put vnder vs in that degree and meaſure of commendation.</p>
            <p>We ſee it true alſo in that loue that the wicked man beareth vnto the harlot and wicked woman: when once loue is kindeled in his heart, he abaſeth himſelfe to al kinde of ſlauerie, forgetting euen the dignitie of a man in his ſubiection or rather ſlaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie vnto her: and all this commeth, bycauſe there is loue kindeled in his heart, the nature whereof is to holde a man in a wonderment at the dignitie &amp; worthineſſe thereof, euen ſo greatly, that all things in himſelfe acknowledge ſubiection therevnto. Therefore to applie this vnto the matter whiche we haue in hande: where loue is, there can be no froward and peeuiſh dealing, no ſwelling and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vppe of himſelfe and his owne giftes againſte him whome he loueth, no vncomely or vnreue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent behauiour in ſpeeche, countenance, or deede, towardes him, other then the place, woorthineſſe, or condition of the man requireth. For loue thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not that the thing loued is ſufficiently ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunced, vnleſſe all other become therein abaſed. For as was ſaide before, Loue and Lordſhippe will abide no fellowſhippe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="215" facs="tcp:7047:116"/>It is profitable to obſerue the diuerſitie of theſe thinges that loue driueth away. Sometimes a man for want of loue towardes another, dealeth fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly and ſtubbernely with him: other ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a man ſhal diſcerne no inſolent and crooked dealing, albeit there be inward ſwelling, &amp; ſetting vppe of him ſelfe againſte him in his heart and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete thoughtes. It may be alſo that both thoſe be lacking, and yet for all y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>, no loue reigning in him: whiche is perceiued herein, that he doth not with reuerent eſtimation thereof, humblie acknowledge the graces and giftes of God in him, and himſelfe alſo duetifully indebted therevnto: or elſe that he entereth not into ſuche a conſideration of that eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate that he is in, whereby he is moued to deale ſo, as vnto that condition, (whether it be proſperous or miſerable) or vnto that man, (whether hee be ſtrong or weake) by good right apperteineth. Which declareth plainely that he wanteth loue, whoſe propertie is to deale comely, either ſo hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie as beſemeth thoſe gifts &amp; great graces of God, or elſe ſo tenderly, as his afflicted condition doeth require. The croked and croſſe dealinges, the hautie hearts declared by highe lookes do plainely ſpeake, that loue is a pilgrime among vs. But if the not reuerent ſubmiting of our ſelues vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> graces of God in another, &amp; not tendering of thoſe that be in neceſſitie and want be added vnto theſe, in whome ſhall we not finde one of theſe three reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing &amp; bearing rule? ſo rare a gyft of God is loue, &amp; ſo muche lieth hidde therein.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="216" facs="tcp:7047:117"/>The opinion that commonly is receiued of loue, what it is, commeth no nearer vnto loue in deede, then doeth blacke vnto white, or light vnto darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: whiche thing to bee true we ſhall eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne, if either we looke vnto ſelfe-loue, or into the naturall loue that parentes do beare vnto their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. For concerning this laſt point of not dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling vncomely, but obſeruing with all reuerence the dignitie of the man: how plainely may we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue this in ſelfe loue? that taketh it ſelfe then rightly regarded, when with reuerence and lowly ſubmiſſion it is honoured: and when a man ſo aduaunceth him, that he doeth with all lowlineſſe put himſelfe vnder him. For loue findeth ſuche worthineſſe and dignitie, as may, by good right, (in the iudgement of him that loueth) clayme reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and ſubmiſſion therevnto.</p>
            <p>The reaſons to perſuade vs to this humble re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerencing of the giftes of God in men by loue, and to forbeare froward dealinges with them, pride and ſwelling againſt them, or vndutifull regard of them are many, and thoſe weyghtie. For firſt of all they are the gifts of God, &amp; therefore he may not want his honour in them. Secondly our gifts how good ſoeuer, are appointed to ſerue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more wee haue, the greater ſeruice is required at our handes: neither may their neglect of duetie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vs, be our diſcharge for want of duetie vnto them. Beſides this, they haue giftes whiche wee want. Moreouer, we doe not ſee their gifts ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced and ſtayned with infirmities, as we doe well
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:7047:117"/>
knowe that ours are, (if wee knowe our ſelues:) which cannot but perſuade vs more highly and reuerently to eſteeme of them, then of our ſelues. For be it that we doe knowe greate infirmities in them, yet is it ſure, that if we do knowe our owne ſelues truely and throughly, we ſhall vnderſtande that there is more lacke in our ſelues then wee can charge them with all. For what we want in mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, we are ſure to haue it in number. If they ſhal be infected with ſome one or fewe notorious of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, whiche we are free of, wee are priuie to ſo greate a number within our ſelues (howſoeuer we be ſhort in the weight and meaſure of ſome ſinne which they are infected withall) as will match the heynouſnes of their offences. This that hath bene ſaid, that our giftes are by the Lorde appointed to the ſeruice of our brethren, in conſideration wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they are our betters: that their giftes are not knowen vnto vs to be ſo defaced with ſin, as we are ſure ours are: is ſpoken to this end, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we ſhould by thoſe &amp; ſuch like conſiderations be drawen to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the grace of God in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For we muſt ſe ſome great thing in them, before we ſhall in trueth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haue our ſelues reuerently, and not careleſly, or vnſeemely towards them. He that loueth, hath in him reuerence towards him whome he loueth, and is voyde of this vncomelineſſe, that knoweth not dignities, degrees, callinges, giftes, or conditions of life: whiche reuerence muſte partely ariſe of that whiche wee conceiue to bee in them, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che wee muſt ſearche out, (rightly examining the
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:7047:118"/>
worthines thereof) that we may be forced to haue that loue, lyking, and eſtimation of him, whiche may driue vs from all ſtubberne, proud, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous dealing: yea from all vncomely &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reuerent dealing toward him, making his excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie to humble vs euen in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wherein we did moſte glorie. Thus muſt wee trauel with our heartes to find out ſome great thing in him: for we can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bow vnto nothing, or by loue reuerence, but where we ſhall haue found ſome worthineſſe and cauſe thereof, yet if there be no greate thing in the man, the Lords authoritie muſt ſtep in, to obteine this loue towardes him, who hath appointed our giftes to ſerue thoſe that haue nede of them.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Loue ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not his owne.</note>Loue is alſo perceiued by this propertie that <hi>It ſeeketh not her owne things:</hi> this is ſet downe alſo in this place, as a token and ſure marke of it: the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning wherof is not that loue letteth go all care and regarde of it ſelfe, but that it is ſo carefull of that whiche it liketh, that in regarde thereof it is often negligent about it ſelfe, not inioying all the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, pleaſure, or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie, that lawfully it might haue. A proofe of this may bee had in parentes, whome nature hath taught to loue their children: they ſeeke not with how little charges they might be diſcharged of them, in putting them off their hands to be apprentiſes of ſome occupatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which may be done with ſmall charges, and is very law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for them to doe, whereby alſo they them ſelues may be the better able to liue, as beeing with ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle coſte vnburdened of them. They inquire not
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:7047:118"/>
thus with how little charges they may be beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but will ſtraine them ſelues oftentimes aboue their abilitie, liuing very ſpareingly and hardly at home, to mainteine them at learning, or at ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing likely to procure their preferment,</p>
            <p>This is loue which ſeeketh not her owne things: whiche teacheth them to forgoe that pleaſure or profite which lawfully they might inioy, to plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and profite their children whome they loue. This propertie of loue did Paule plainely declare,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 9.</note> when that he did not burthen the congregation as lawfully he might. By this propertie of loue it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to paſſe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> men hauing once learned what is lawful, begin to inquire then, whether that ſame be expedient to be done or otherwiſe, becauſe not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that it be lawfull:<note place="margin">1. Cor 5.</note> yet loue will not doe it, vnleſſe it be alſo expedient. By this it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to paſſe, that thoſe which be ſtrong, will not alwayes proceede in the ſtrength of their perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to doe accordingly,<note place="margin">Rom. 15.1.</note> but forbeare their right to winne the weake withall. This propertie of loue is lacking euery where. For almoſt all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wil haue all their pleaſures and all their profits; not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going any parte thereof, although the Goſpell and them ſelues do heare much euil for it euery where. If we may once ſay it is lawful, I may do it by law or it is not forbidden, but permitted by the word, we neuer inquire further. This proueth manifeſtly that loue is not in vs, which ſeketh not after all that it may, but is contented to departe from her owne right, oftentimes, therby to declare her affection to
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:7047:119"/>
them whome ſhe loueth: eſpecially when the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of her to her owne, is like to bring diſcredite vnto that whiche ſhe loueth. In preſeruing our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities or our pleaſures, we alwayes followe them, to the vttermoſte of that which is lawfull: we driue our commodities as far alwayes, as by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny meanes may be accounted lawfull: and if at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny time wee bee accuſed of hard dealinge, wee aunſwere, it is a couenaunt: a plaine bargaine: true buying and ſelling: it is lawfull: as if loue vnto the Goſpell (if it were in vs) would not make vs ſometimes to giue in, and relent of that we might demaund, to get credit therevnto, and to ſtop the mouthes of the euil ſpeaker and ſlaunderer, when we ſee that wee cannot holde that, but wee muſt procure euil ſpeeche to our profeſſion. Likewiſe, when we are charged with exceſſiue vſing of recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, or apparell: forthwith we anſwere, recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are lawfull: apparell is lawfull: wee may vſe it. But loue ſeeketh not all that it may. When our profeſſion is euil ſpoken of, the Goſpel blamed to be a doctrine of libertie, ſhould not the loue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto make vs ceaſſe to ſeeke all that wee may, and beginne to inquire what is moſt conuenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe glorie to God withall? When thoſe which ſtriue for mayſteries are deſireous to get the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 9.</note> and haue a loue therevnto, they doe not ſit downe to reckon how many kindes of meates they may lawfully feede vppon, and yet be able to run with ſome ſpeede, but they conſult how many they had neede to abſteine from, that they may be
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:7047:119"/>
likely to preuaile and get commendation by run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. Thus hath loue taught them to defraude them ſelues of many ſweete morſels which, law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully they might take, to inioy but ſome corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thing. For loue ſeeketh not all it may, but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goeth much of her right, for their pleaſure whom ſhe ſo greatly liketh.</p>
            <p>Miſerable therfore are theſe times, wherein ſo many go further in pleaſures and commodities, then by any lawful meanes they may doe: and the better ſort ſtand at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtaues end with God, not yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding one iote of thoſe profites or pleaſures that by any colour of lawfulnes they can lay claime vnto, notwithſtanding his name (that is ſo euill ſpoken of for this obſtinate vſe of their libertie) doth euen begge it at their hands, that they ſhould relente of their right, and ſomething giue in vnto their God. Where are they to be founde whome the care of their brethren doeth ſo occupie, that it taketh them vp from ſome of their lawfull commodities, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and cares, to bee occupyed the more where their loue reſteth? Loue is full of paines, where it loueth:<note place="margin">1. Theſ. 1.</note> therefore doeth the Apoſtle giue laboure and labouriouſneſſe vnto it, as the proper note to diſcerne it: wherevnto accordeth that which is ſet downe heere, that it is ſo much occupied where it loueth, that oftentimes it neglecteth it ſelfe. This propertie of loue, notably deſcrieth idle and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe paſtors and preachers of the word: whiche ſo much ſeeke the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, that they neglect their flock and charges: wheras if there were loue in deed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:7047:120"/>
them, it would beget in them the care there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, euen with the neglect of them ſelues, in reſpect of the care and paines taken with them. This pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie muſt euery man try him ſelfe by, in his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling whatſoeuer. For if the Lord ſhall accepte of our dealings therein, it is mete &amp; requiſite that they be done in loue which is ful of ſeruice &amp; paine to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that which it loueth.</p>
            <p>To relent of our right vnto God for his glorie, is no work of ſupererogatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which we are not bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vnto (as the church of Rome hath taught) but due debte.) For we doe owe loue vnto God from the ground of our heart, and loue ſeeketh not all her owne, but oftentimes frankly and freely giueth of her right vnto God. Herein alſo we may diſcerne, that loue hath great things in it, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it mightily car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth the affections to that which it loueth, &amp; kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth them occupied there, euen oftentimes to the neglect of it ſelf. The rarenes of it and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure that we ſhall ſee our ſelues come ſhort thereof, muſt force vs to often &amp; earneſt prayer to God for it: wherin it ſhall be profitable to remember, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this not ſeeking of our ſelues but the good of others, is in trueth the next way to benefit our ſelues. For as the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d which is occupied alwaies in giuing forth help to the mouth, or other partes of the body, doth in ſo doing prouide for it ſelfe &amp; hath his nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, help, and health, of that whiche it hath giuen vnto the mouth, ſo by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eſpeciall working of God it commeth to paſſe, that our benefite is incloſed in that which we beſtowe vpon another, and he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:7047:120"/>
the beſt huſband for him ſelfe, that is moſt employed according to his calling vppon other. This is a ſpeciall work we may ſee of Gods grace: for our nature is wholy giuen to attend vpon her ſelfe, little regarding (ſo matters go wel there) how it fareth with others abroade. Loue in like ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner is knowen thus, that it <hi>is not prouoked vnto anger:</hi> it is not eaſily incenſed, though wrong be offered vnto it. For the heart is ſo knit by loue, that it can well beare many wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs. This note, wherby loue is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, differeth not much fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that propertie which was ſpoken of in the firſt place, ſaue that to ſpeake properly, that is a meekeneſſe ioyned with doings, &amp; this with ſuffring. This hardnes to be prouoked vnto anger, is procured by the help of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, being another token of loue, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it thinketh not euill, or imputeth not euill. For in as much as it ſtandeth not vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the matter, examining y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> euil dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is in it, but by loue either altogether paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth ouer it, or elſe twiteth and blameth ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thinge for it, as a cauſe that moued the doer therevnto, and ſo remoueth it from him: therefore it cannot be incenſed therewith or prouoked vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to anger. Parents in dealing with their children do plainely proue that loue wanteth this diligent conſidering, thinking vppon, or through exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the euil of their children. For how many of their froward doings do they paſſe ouer, &amp; not examine at all? In how many thinges which they ſe to be offences in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, doe they notwithſtanding
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:7047:121"/>
put ouer the whole blame thereof, to ſome one thing or other? as that their frowardneſſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth for lack of ſleepe, or want of meate, &amp;c. For loue cannot ryfle into the euill, to be muſing and thinking much vpon it, diligently examining the wickednes how great it is that doeth appeare in it: loue cannot ſtand vpon it, to gather together the coniectures that may be had of great euill to be in it. Hereby it appeareth that loue is far from ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of euil, where there is no apparant toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, ſeeing it paſſeth with ſuch ſpeede, and turneth the thoughts ſo ſoone from muſing vpon, and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining ſeene and knowen euils, in thoſe whome it loueth.</p>
            <p>It is alſo incident vnto loue as a true marke to diſcerne it by, <hi>not to reioyce in iniquitie, but to reioyce in the trueth.</hi> So doth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holie ghoſt report of it in this place. The <hi>trueth,</hi> wherein he that loueth is ſaid to reioyce, ſignifieth true and ſincere dealing, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the vſuall ſpeech of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſcripture: which may alſo be vnderſtode, in that it is ſet heere againſt ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie or vnrighteouſneſſe, as being contrarie ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto. This propertie of <hi>not reioycing in iniquitie,</hi> is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fitly ioyned vnto the former. For in that it was ſaid not to thinke euill, but friendly not to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute it, it might bee thought that loue had a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the euill dealing of him whome ſhee lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth: therfore is this added, that it reioyceth not in his euill dealing &amp; vnrighteouſnes. For theſe may wel ſtand together: not to ſearch into euill thinges
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:7047:121"/>
to withdrawe his affection from the offender therein, and yet for all that to bee grieued that the thing is done. For he well vnderſtandeth, that that whiche is done vnrighteouſly, can not but turne to his diſcredite and reproch, which he wold bee loath ſhould happen vnto him whome hee ſo tenderly loueth. The moſt wicked man that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, would bee loath that the man whome he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth ſhould doe any thing, whiche (in his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) coulde not but bring harme or hurte vnto him: and when any ſuch thing eſcapeth him, hee is grieued and vexed at it. If it be ſayd againſt the trueth of this, that when one wicked man loueth an other, yet he will reioyce at many things done wickedly and vniuſtly by him whome he loueth: To this it may be anſwered, that hee (according to the blindneſſe and hardneſſe of his heart) think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not that his ſuche dealing will any waye turne to his hurte or diſcredite: but thinketh rather that it will woorke his credite, amonge thoſe men that hee vſeth to make account of: as for feare of puniſhment from GOD againſt him, that is farr out of ſight. Herevpon it is plaine, that perfect loue is not to bee found but among the godly: for all other through blindneſſe and hardneſſe of heart, reioyce at many thinges done by thoſe whome they loue, which are not ſincere and righteous: and therefore muſt turne to their hurte, from the handes of the Lorde: which yet they do not ſo much as once ſurmiſe, bicauſe their iudgement of things is not according to the word
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:7047:122"/>
of God. Heere falleth downe that great piller of Poperie which cryeth with open mouth for loue and vnitie, and yet ſmothereth trueth, righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and ſinceritie, reioycing and triumphing in that, which the trueth and righteouſneſſe of God ſet downe in his woorde, vtterly condemneth. Here alſo is condemned that damnable ſect whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che termeth it ſelf the Familie of loue, who vphol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their loue like vnto the Papiſtes, are cleane gone from the trueth and righteouſneſſe of God approued by his woord, vnto a righteouſneſſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued by the reuelation of their owne ſpirit, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the woorde of GOD the playneſong whiche their ſpirite may deſcant vppon, as ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth good vnto it ſelfe: but alwayes ſo, that there be no melodie but from their owne mouth. For they will haue the woorde to haue no ſoundneſſe nor certeintie in it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>Heereby is all the friendſhippe of the wicked condemned, who will haue no long liking of any, but ſuche as will ioy with them in their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: for they will not holde friendſhippe with them, that will not lend them the credite of their countenaunce, and if neede bee of their othe alſo, to helpe out euill cauſes withall. Heere alſo are all theſe detected of want of loue, who publiſhe abroade the infirmities of their brethren to thoſe, to whome in no conſideration it is behouefull to be knowne.</p>
            <p>Loue reioyceth not in iniquitie, nor in vnrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous or not ſincere dealing of him whome he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:7047:122"/>
not in the vnrighteous or not ſincere dealing of others towardes him. For the loue which hee beareth towardes him, forceth him to miſlike of all annoyance and wrong, that happeneth vnto him. And bycauſe of this, hee can not but with griefe heare of any wrong or hard meaſure offered vnto him: ſo farre is hee him ſelfe from dealing euill or hardly with him. Loue reioyceth not in iniquitie, but it reioyceth or ioyeth together with him at the truth, or ſinceritie, and vprightneſſe of his dealing: bycauſe that wil turne to his good, and haue approbation and allowance euen from men.</p>
            <p>Loue ſo laceth it ſelfe in the commendable do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of him whome it loueth, and the man that loueth, taketh pleaſure in the well doing of him whome hee loueth. Therefore, if there bee true loue in vs, wee muſt not onely not enuie the good doings of our brethren, but wee muſt acquainte our heartes to ioy with them in their good doing, and good report for the ſame.</p>
            <p>It is a good degree of profiting to haue driuen away enuie: but wee muſt proceede further, to ioye with him in his well doing, and deſerued commendation for the ſame. For men deale well with him, when they ſhall iuſtifie his ſinceritie by their talke and ſpeach: which if our heart repyne at, nay if it doe not ioy at it, that plainly bewrayeth want of loue to be in vs towards them.</p>
            <p>When wee ſhall come once to this, to ioy in heart at their vprighte dealing, that their good dealing ſhall bee the comforte of our hearte,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:7047:123"/>
wee ſhall not be able to denie them any helpe that is in vs of counſel or admonition, that may eyther encourage them to good, or withdrawe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from that which is euill, nay, we ſhall bee readie to offer it vnasked for: eſpecially, when wee ſhall perceiue ſome neede thereof.</p>
            <p>Theſe things which are in the laſt place attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted vnto loue, as that <hi>it ſuffereth all things: it belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth all things: hopeth all things: endureth all things:</hi> do declare, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a louing man is of a verie patient ſpirite towarde his brother, euen in his infirmities, and that he layeth his handes ſoftly vpon the ſoares of him whome hee loueth, and deſireth to haue them healed, hauing a great burthen of griefe vpon him ſelf for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which notwithſtanding loue teacheth him to goe vnder and to abide, and not deintily or impatiently and roughly with ſpeede to caſt it off.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe it is declared heere, that loue is of a good and eaſie diſpoſition, to beleue and hope wel of him whome he loueth. Wee may not thinke when it is ſayde that loue <hi>beleeueth all thinges,</hi> and <hi>endureth all things,</hi> that loue wanteth all iudgement to diſcerne: but the meaning of the holy Ghoſte is by that vniuerſall note, to declare how much they are inclined that way, and eaſily induced there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto, when there is any good matter to moue them therein. As for that lightneſſe in beleeuing, that commeth for want of wit and iudgement, it is eaſily diſcerned from that which proceedeth of charitie and loue.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="229" facs="tcp:7047:123"/>When we ſhal haue tryed truely our dealings to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde God, our dealings toward our neighbours, and our dealings in our ſeuerall callings, by theſe affections which are reported by the holy Ghoſte to be in loue, it will appeare, that to be a Chriſtian is a rare matter, a mightie, rare, and eſpecial worke of God.

according as of late it was proued vnto vs. The Scripture is playne in this matter, that no man can fulfill the lawe. In the Epiſtle to the Galathians, the Apoſtle affirmeth all thoſe to bee curſſed that clayme righteouſneſſe for the workes of the lawe which they haue done: and hee vſeth this reaſon, to proue that all ſuch are vnder the curſſe: <hi>For it is written,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 3.10.</note> (ſayth he) <hi>Curſſed is euerie man that continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not in all things which are written in the booke of the lawe, to doe them:</hi> taking it for an vndoubted truth, that no man continueth in doing all thoſe things. This reaſon is no reaſon, if the Churche of Rome may be beleeued. It is no reaſon with them, to ſay euerie man is curſſed that hopeth for ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the woorkes of the lawe doone by him, bycauſe the lawe curſſeth him that continueth not in all duties of the lawe to doe them.</p>
            <p>For they ſay, that a man may continue in all thinges that are commaunded him in the lawe, to doe them, in that they ſay a man maye fulfill the lawe. And if a man maye continue in doing all thinges that are commaunded, then is hee free from the curſſe of the lawe: bycauſe the lawe cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth none, but ſuche as continue not in the fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of all thinges in it.</p>
            <p>But the holie Ghoſte taketh that, as graunted of all men, that there is no man that continueth in all thinges that are written in the booke of the lawe to doe them: and therefore thinketh, that hee hath ſufficiently proued, that which hee affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:7047:124"/>
that all men, who lay clayme to righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe by the woorkes of the lawe are accurſſed.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle affirmeth euerie man to bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſſed that ſeeketh for righteouſneſſe from the lawe: bycauſe the lawe dealeth ſo ſtrictly and hardly with man, that it curſſeth euerie man who continueth not in doing all the thinges com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded in it: whiche the Apoſtle taketh to bee impoſsible, and therevppon is bolde to affirme all men to lye vnder the curſſe of the lawe, for not hauing continued in all the dueties there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
            <p>But the Churche of Rome acquiteth them of that curſſe, affirming plainely, that a man maye keepe the lawe, and continue in all the dueties thereof, for want whereof and for no other cauſe the Apoſtle did lay the curſſe vppon euerie man. It may not bee omitted, that there is ſuche con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarietie of iudgement betweene the doctrine of the Apoſtle, and the doctrine of the Churche of Rome, that the Apoſtle ſhould take this as graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that no man can continue in all things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded in the lawe, and therefore all men to bee accurſſed: and they of the Churche to holde it as a receyued doctrine and approued of them all, that a man may continue in all the woorkes of the lawe, and fulfill and keepe the lawe: in ſo muche as they are not aſhamed to pronounce him to be accurſſed, who ſhall holde, that the lawe doth lay any impoſsible thing vpon vs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="232" facs="tcp:7047:125"/>The Apoſtle doth take it to bee ſo plaine, that no man can kepe the lawe, that he will not beſtow any paines in the proofe thereof. The Churche of Rome taketh it to bee ſo playne, that a man may keepe the lawe, that they do accurſſe him, whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer ſhall holde the contrarie. But it behoueth vs to reſt in the doctrine of the holie Ghoſte, which therefore holdeth all men accurſſed that ſticke vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the righteouſneſſe of woorkes, bycauſe no man can do all thoſe workes to the which righteouſnes and life is promiſed. And righteouſneſſe is promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, not vnto him that ſhall doe ſome fewe works, but vnto him that ſhal haue done all that are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the booke of the law. Neyther yet vnto him that for a great time ſhall haue done all, but vnto him that ſhall haue continued from the beginning, vnto the ende of his life, in doing all the workes that are commaunded in the lawe. Whereby it appeareth, that that man who ſhall offend but in one thing forbidden in the lawe, is in ſo doing ſhut out from all hold and hope of righteouſneſſe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. For he is holden accurſſed by the lawe, that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth not in all thinges that are written in the booke of the lawe to doe them. For the lawe doth offer vs wages for our worke, but ſo, that it refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to pay any penie, but vnto him that ſhall bring all his worke finiſhed and done: bycauſe the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunt was ſo: and the lawe dealeth by Indenture and couenaunt and not otherwiſe. Hee ſhall not want hyre for his labour, that ſhall haue done his whole taske, and all that was ſet &amp; appointed him
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:7047:125"/>
for to do. For the Lorde did couenant with vs for accompliſhment of thoſe works, that were agreed vpon and ſet downe in the lawe, that when wee ſhould haue perfourmed that obedience, it might be lawfull for vs, to clayme our wages: which is, that he that doth them, ſhall liue in them.<note place="margin">Gal. 3.12.</note> But if wee ſhould come with our worke halfe done and halfe vndone, or any (euen the leaſt) part vndone, the lawe ſendeth vs away without wages: letting vs ſee the condition of the obligation, whiche is, that he ſtandeth accurſſed, without all hope of hire from the lawe, that ſhall not continue to doe all things that are commaunded. For the law wil not goe one iote from couenaunt. In deede it will keepe couenaunt with vs, if we keepe couenaunt with it, and bring our whole worke accompliſhed according to the Indenture. If a man ſhoulde for tenne, twentie, or fourtie yeare, or if it were poſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that from his infancie vnto his dying day, hee ſhould haue bene a painefull workman to the law, doing all the workes thereof truely and without blame, and yet ſlippe in one thing, if but in one thought, euen vpon his dying day, he doth therein forfeit his obligation, wherein he ſtandeth bound for continuing in al the works of the law vnto the end. <hi>Curſſed is he</hi> (ſayth the lawe) <hi>that continueth not.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 3.10.</note> And as was ſayd before, the lawe dealeth not but by Indenture, and therefore looketh for and will haue the benefite of the obligation and the forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the bond at our hands. If it ſhall bee ſayde that the good workes that we haue done ſhall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:7047:126"/>
vs of the euill that we haue done, that aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere will not bee taken: there is no reaſon in it, nor lawe for it. For when we are bound to doe thoſe woorkes (which we ſay will diſcharge vs from the euill woorkes that wee haue done) and more then they be, (for wee are bound to doe all, and it is due debt of our part,) howe commeth it to paſſe, by what right or reaſon, that parte of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of one ſumme whiche is due debt from vs, ſhoulde not onely diſcharge that whole debt, (it beeing but a parte thereof) but alſo ſhoulde diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge vs of an other bond, wherein wee ſtande bounde for the payment of an other ſumme of monie?</p>
            <p>Wee ſtande bound not onely to doe well, but alſo to abſteine from doing euill. The diſcharge of one bonde (if it were fully diſcharged) coulde doe no more, but free vs from the daunger of that: it can not acquite vs of the other bond, wherein wee ſtande other wayes charged. To apply it to our purpoſe, the bond wherein wee ſtand charged for doing well, being in ſome part aunſwered, can not cancel the other obligation wherein we ſtand bound to abſteine from euill.</p>
            <p>There is no man that hath an other bound vnto him in two ſeuerall obligations for two ſeuerall ſummes of monie, that will by and by after that one is diſcharged, take the other by that payment to bee as good as cancelled: there is in it neyther lawe, right, nor reaſon.</p>
            <p>Much leſſe will any man be ſo fooliſh, as when
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:7047:126"/>
but ſome parte of the one ſhall bee payde, to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that then hee muſt giue ouer, not onely the clayme of the other parte yet behinde, but alſo the whole debt of the other bond, which in no parte hath bene diſcharged.</p>
            <p>Theſe things being conſidered, we ſhall be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to ſay with the Apoſtle, So many as ſticke vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the woorkes of the lawe, are vnder the curſſe. For it is written, <hi>Curſſed is euerie man that continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not in all thinges which are written in the booke of the lawe to doe them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If any man ſhall thinke with him ſelfe that this reaſon is not ſufficient to proue all accurſſed, bycauſe euerie one that dothe not continue is accurſſed, imagining that a man may continue in all thinges: let him examine him ſelfe by eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie commaundement in euerie ſeuerall dutie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: adding therevnto the properties of loue, and conſidering whether his affection may be proued by thoſe effectes, to beare loue vnto the lawe and the dueties of the lawe, or otherwiſe: ioyning with all his continuaunce in euerie thing, euen in the thoughtes of his heart: and then, no doubt, it will bee manifeſt vnto him ſelfe, that hee is farre from that righteouſneſſe whiche the lawe requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, and hee by it is bound to perfourme it. Hee ſhall then ſee, that hee him ſelfe is farre ſhorte of that number of workes which haue promiſe of life made vnto the workers therof, when they ſhall haue acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pliſhed thoſe workes in that number of deeds, &amp; that louing maner of doing, which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lord
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:7047:127"/>
requireth: eſpecially if that prouiſo be remembred, that there muſt be continuance without interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, both in the deedes and manner of doing, euen vnto the end.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, the puniſhments in this world whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che the godlyeſt that euer liued haue not beene al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together free from, declare that no man kepeth the lawe. For the lawe doth not onely promiſe free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome from puniſhments, but alſo plentie of al ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of bleſsings in the frut of our body, in the fruit of our ground, in the increaſe of our kyne, cattle, flockes of ſheepe, in our comming in, in our going out, in all that we take in hand, in cauſing all that riſe vp againſt vs to fal before our face. &amp;c. But y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> godlieſt man that euer liued, was neuer free from all thoſe puniſhments that there are appointed for the tranſgreſſours of the lawe, nor yet bleſſed with all thoſe bleſsings in all thinges which are promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to them that keepe the lawe:<note place="margin">Deut. 28.</note> and therevppon we may ſafely conclude, that the godlieſt man that euer liued, did neuer fulfill the lawe. For then ſurely the Lorde woulde haue ſtoode ſtedfaſt to his promiſe, both to haue procured all theſe bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings promiſed vnto him, and alſo to haue kept euerie part of thoſe puniſhments from him, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che are appoynted for the tranſgreſſours of the commaundements of God.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 1.18</note>In this manner dothe the Apoſtle proue that righteouſneſſe commeth by the mercies of GOD taken holde on by faythe, bycauſe the wrath of GOD is reuealed from heauen, againſte all vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſſe

And therefore hee doth ſtrengthen his former affirmation, that the iuſt man ſhall liue by faythe, which was his purpoſe to proue vnto them, and vnto the whiche ende he directeth all his ſpeache in thoſe foure chapters.</p>
            <p>In like manner,<note place="margin">Rom. 5.12 14.</note> the Apoſtle proueth to the Romanes, that all men had ſinne, (euen children that did neuer committe any actuall offence,) by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe death (which is the puniſhment of ſinne) did take holde vpon all.</p>
            <p>This one puniſhment therefore, if there were no other, may ſuffice to proue, that no man euer did keepe the lawe, bycauſe death whiche is a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment for tranſgreſsing the lawe dothe ſeaze vpon all men, of what eſtate, degree, or yeares ſo euer.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="238" facs="tcp:7047:128"/>It is the reaſon of the Apoſtle in that place, that bycauſe all had ſinned, therefore death came vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all: prouiding by the dealing of GOD againſt man in puniſhing of him, that man had dealt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt GOD, in tranſgreſsing of his lawe and commaundements: nay, prouiding (which is yet more,) that bicauſe GOD puniſhed al men, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore euerie man hathe offended againſt him in tranſgreſsing his lawes and commaundementes: ſo that there is no man that can ſay hee hath or doth fulfill the lawe.</p>

            <p>Moreouer, who can lett the Lorde who is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted vnto no man, to promiſe eternally lyfe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what deedes or couenauntes ſo euer ſeeme good vnto him? Shall it be vnlawfull for a man who hath ſome portion of lande to ſell, to ſaye vnto a poore man, (who is not able to gyue halfe ſo muche as hee dothe offer to ſell it for, and as it is woorth in deede,) Thus muche I meane to haue for it of him who ſo euer ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy it?</p>
            <p>Is it vnlawfull thus to price it, bycauſe the pore man is not woorth ſo muche as will purchaſe it? Dothe his pouertie make the lande of leſſe value,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:7047:129"/>
eyther elſe make it vnlawfull for him to require any thing like as the goodneſſe of the ground doth deſerue?</p>
            <p>No man will thinke this to haue any equitie or right in it. No more ſurely hath this other: that our pouertie and want ſhoulde make it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull for the Lorde, to eſteeme the treaſures of his kingdome aboue all the obedience that wee can perfourme, and to ſet them at a greater price then this pouertie and want that wee are in, ſhall euer bee able to reach vnto.</p>
            <p>If it bee further demaunded what meaning the Lorde had in promiſing lyfe vnto vs, for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that which hee knewe wee neuer coulde perfourme and bring to paſſe, it is to bee aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered: that the Lorde did it, to let vs (who are ſo well perſuaded by the nature of our owne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie) ſee clearely into our pouertie and wante, howe great it is: that wee might haue true triall within our ſelues, howe greatly wee are beholden vnto the free mercies of GOD in Ieſus Chriſte. When wee ſhall haue ſeene plainely by the lawe, howe vnable wee are to perfourme, that there is required to bee done of ſo many as hope for wages by reaſon of their woorke, and that if wee will lay clayme to the mercyes of GOD for our woorkes, wee remaine accurſſed for euerie ſinne and offence againſt the law committed by vs: bycauſe it is the written ſentence of the lawe, that <hi>Hee is curſſed that continueth not in all thinges
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:7047:129"/>
that are written in the booke of the law to do them.</hi> Then not from the bare ſpeeche of our mouth, but from the true tryall of our heart, wee are ſente to the mercies of GOD alone, to ſtick wholy vnto them, acknowledging all our goodneſſe to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede from thence alone, and are compelled by the ſenſe and feeling of our owne wantes made kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen vnto vs by the law, to let paſſe all that opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our owne workes which we before were ſo well perſuaded of. As if ſome impotent and lame childe, that were in deede able to doe nothing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes the earning of his liueing, (beeing charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to his father, not onely for him ſelfe, but alſo for one that ſhould giue attendaunce vnto him:) ſhould in the fooliſh perſuaſion of ſome trifleing worke that he doeth, perſuade him ſelfe that hee is ſo farre from chargeing his father, that hee is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come very helpfull vnto him, bringing in a greate portion of that whereby the whole familie is mainteined: wherevppon the father ſetteth him to ſome worke, promiſing to giue him wages for it, as he doeth vnto day-labouring-men, that the ouerplus of his charges maye redounde to his owne profite alone. When the fooliſhe impotent childe ſeeth by good experience, that hee is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to doe any thing to the maintenaunce of his liueing, then hee is forced to acknowledge his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers liberalitie, and to confeſſe his vndeſerued goodneſſe towards him, whiche before hee made no reckoning of, pleaſing him ſelfe in the fooliſhe
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:7047:130"/>
perſuaſion of his owne earning, vntill by good tryall it hath beene proued vnto him to bee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
            <p>In like manner the Lorde our GOD, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling that wee ſhould take our ſelues as wee are in deede beholden to his mercie, and onely cleaue to that, is conſtrayned to bring vs from this fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhe perſuaſion of our deſeruings and earninges by our owne workes, (the perſuaſion whereof keepeth vs from magnifying of his mercies as wee are bounde:) and to ſet vs to worke for wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, appoynting vs hyre for laboure, and wages for a certeine number of workes: wherein when wee ſhall haue taken tryall of our owne inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciencie to mainteine our ſelues, we ſhall be forced to lay holde of his alone mercies, and in true hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie acknowledge the benefite thereof, whiche was a principall end that the LORD did looke at, in loading vs with that ſo greate laboure of the lawe, and exactinge a continuaunce in euery woorke thereof, ſo ſtreightly at our han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des.</p>
            <p>For the promiſe to bee receiued to mercie in the merites of Chriſte alone, was made foure hundreth yeeres and more before the lawe, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che came in to driue vs by due experience of our ſelues, to ſticke wholy vnto the bountie of that his mercie: whiche thing to be ſo, he Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle

proueth by the nature of the lawe that was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.</p>
            <p>For ſuche a lawe was giuen as (by meanes of our weakeneſſe) coulde not giue life. And therefore ſure it is, that the LORD ment not that wee ſhould looke for happineſſe from the lawe and the obedience thereof, but wholy from the mercies of God in Chriſte.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If there had beene a lawe giuen</hi> (ſayeth the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle) <hi>whiche coulde haue giuen life, ſurely righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe ſhould haue beene by the lawe:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 3.21.</note> 
               <hi>But the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath concluded all vnder ſinne, that the promiſe by the faith of IESVS CHRISTE ſhould be giuen to them that beleeue. Wherefore the lawe was our Schoole-maiſter to bring vs to CHRISTE, that we might bee made righteous by faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Apoſtle ſayeth, that if there had beene gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſuche a lawe as coulde haue giuen life, righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe ſhould haue come by the lawe.</p>
            <p>Sure it is, that the want which was in the lawe to giue life, was not in it ſelfe: for it did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe life vnto them that kepte it, whiche pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe made by the LORD to the keepers of the Lawe, it were blaſphemie once to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that hee woulde not, or coulde not, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourme.</p>
            <p>Therfore the want that was in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law to giue life
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:7047:131"/>
commeth wholy of our infirmitie: by reaſon of the weakeneſſe that is in fleaſhe and bloud, as it is written to the Romanes:<note place="margin">Rom. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Greate is the opinion that fleaſhe and bloud hath of it ſelfe, when the Lorde is conſtrained to bring a looking-glaſſe of his lawe for vs, before we can bee brought to iudge rightly of our ſelues.</p>
            <p>Great is the credit of our owne deſeruing and earning by our well doeing, when the Lorde to pull vs from it, is forced to putt vs to the try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of an impoſſible work. Hardly are we brought from the opinion of our owne wealthie eſtate, when the Lorde cannot be beleeued of vs: tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling vs the contrarie, before hee hath layde before vs in his accounting booke, our ſeuerall parcels of debte.</p>
            <p>A Chriſtian therefore is taughte by the ende that GOD had in giuing of this lawe, to learne how harde a thinge it is to lay downe all lyking of him ſelfe, and opinion of wel deſeruing for his deedes, in as much as the Lord is driuen to reckon with vs particularly, &amp; proue vnto vs by plaine e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we are worſe then nothing, before wee can be made to let go the opinion y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we haue once co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiued of our owne good eſtate. Therfore who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:7047:131"/>
meaneth to depend truely vpon God, muſt by the often ſight of him ſelfe in the lawe, be wey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from the opinion of his owne doeings, while that in ſeeing his deformities ſo muche in euery parte (by meanes of the ſundrie and ſeuerall due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that are commaunded,) hee be compelled by good tryall to acknowledge the benefite of his bloud, whereby they are wyped away. For it is the true tryall of our ſelues, that maketh Chriſte to be of any reckoning with vs. It is the true miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liking of our ſelues that cauſeth vs to like of him. How neceſſarie then is it for vs, not onely to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge a kinde of debte, but to ſee the ſeuerall parcels thereof in euery commaundement grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſuch a greate ſumme, as ſhould offer iuſte occaſion to thinke highely of him, who hath brought vs a free diſcharge, for theſe ſo many and ſundrie billes of debte.</p>
            <p>Let vs learne then often to go vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> counting booke of our God: to ſee in euerie commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the great debt that we are drawen into, that wee may haue occaſion knowen to our ſelues to be very greate, why we ſhould wholy beetake vs to the mercyes of our God. It falleth out often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, that a manne who is deepely in debte, for want of earneſt conſideration had of the ſeuerall ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mes &amp; parcels of the ſame, may take it to be no greate benefite to be diſcharged thereof: but when the particulars be ſummoned and brought in, and in the whole thereof appeareth to be a great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:7047:132"/>
to diſcharge, hee beginneth to chaunge his minde, and to take him for a ſpeciall friend that would offer to aunſwere it: euen ſo it commeth to paſſe with vs, while in generall words of courſe we confeſſe our ſelues to bee ſinners, and therefore indebted vnto GOD, but yet neuer truely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider by true tryall of our ſelues in euery com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, what the particulars are whereof the generall ariſeth ſo great.</p>
            <p>Wee make no greate account of the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies brought by Chriſte for the diſcharge there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, becauſe the greateneſſe of the debt and daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, for wante of ſumming the particulars, is not truely knowen nor rightly conſidered of: which is the thing that maketh a right reckoning bothe of our owne wante, and alſo of his worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, in releaſing vs from ſo greate daunger and debte,</p>
            <p>By this we may clearely perceiue, that ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as ſhall not often looke to their liues by the lawe, doe neither knowe what wretchedneſſe is in them ſelues, nor yet what mercie is in Chriſte.</p>
            <p>For beeing ignoraunt of the ſeuerall parcels, they doe iudge amiſſe of the whole, and therefore of the greatneſſe of that benefite that hath diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged all. Thoſe men that are not acquainted with the often ſighte of their ſeuerall ſinnes by the lawe and commaundementes, may fitly bee compared to a man that hath ſome ſore in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:7047:132"/>
which he diſcerneth by ſome little hole appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in the ſkinne, yet ſo as he maketh nothing of it, neither thinketh to be any greate benefite to be cured thereof: for it appeareth to him to bee verye little, by reaſon of the ſmall quantitie of ſkinne that is broken: but after y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it beeing ſearched and lanced, there is knowen to be ſo muche dead fleaſhe about it, as (beeing taken out) maketh the hole tenne times greater then before: then hee beginneth to thinke what daunger hee is in for the decay of his whole bodie, if that parte bee not well healed, and therefore taketh it for a greate and ſingular benefite to be cured thereof, whiche before he did nothing at all eſteeme,</p>
            <p>No leſſe neceſſarie is it for vs by ſearching into our ſeuerall corruptions, by euery com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundemente, to cutt away the dead fleaſhe of careleſſeneſſe and good lyking of our eſtate, or at the leaſte of findeing no greate lacke in it, whiche hindereth the true enterteyning of the free mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Chriſte.</p>
            <p>For it is the burthen that wee feele of ſinne by the lawe, whiche maketh grace ſweete and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable vnto vs: and they that be loaden with the weight of ſinne, bee thoſe whome the Lorde hath promiſed to eaſe, as it is written in Matthew: <hi>Come vnto mee all yee that are wearie and loaden,</hi>

            <p>One contrarie maketh an other better know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en. Libertie is neuer ſo ſwete, as when it commeth immediately after bondage.

It is miſerie that maketh a right account of mercie. It is miſerie that maketh mercie to be mercie. The lawe muſt let vs ſee our miſerie, that we may haue right regarde of mercie. If it were ſo expedient for Paule to haue the meſſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Sathan to buffet him, leſt he ſhould be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted out of meaſure for the abundaunce of Gods giftes, that praying often that it might departe from him, he could not be heard to haue it taken cleane away,<note place="margin">2.

            <p>
               <pb n="249" facs="tcp:7047:133"/>This doctrine vtterly ouerthroweth them, that reſt in their workes: looking for righteouſnes and iuſtification, from their owne deſeruings &amp; good deedes, becauſe they haue kept the lawe of God in their owne opinion, and therefore may iuſtly lay clayme to eternall life for thoſe their good deedes.</p>
            <p>This doctrine alſo condemneth all ſecure men, that haue no ſenſe of ſinne: For the lawe ſhould ſo lay open vnto vs the ſoares of our ſinnes, that the verie ſight thereof might ſende vs to Chriſte. For the ende of it is ſo to charge vs with our owne woful eſtate, that we may be driuen to giue ouer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtrongeſt holde that we haue, whiche is the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our ſelues, and fortifie our ſelues in Chriſt &amp; in his mercies alone. It is the greateſt worke of the Lorde to win this hold at our hands: yet if we remaine in it, we are but dead men and caſte away euerie one of vs. The Lord therefore meaning to hyde vs in his mercies, and there to make a ſure &amp; ſafe harboroughe for vs, doeth ſhoote off this war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning peece of the lawe, ſo to ſhake this ruinous holde of our owne good deedes, that we ſeeing in deede the weakeneſſe thereof, may take vs to his mercies alone: a holde that will holde in deede.</p>
            <p>The practiſe of ſathan by the Lawe, is in extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities: for either he woulde driue vs to deſpaire thereby, or elſe touch vs not at all therewith. But we are learned out of the worde of God, that the office of the lawe is to ioyne vs to Chriſte: and to keepe vs from bothe theſe rockes of ſecuritie and
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:7047:134"/>
deſpaire whiche are two daungerous rockes, and therefore needefull for all men to take heede of, in this voyage of Chriſtianitie. For either of them bothe, doeth threat to make ſhipwracke of our ſaluation.</p>
            <p>Let vs therefore require of the Lawe to do that which vnto it apperteineth: that it would ſo let vs ſee our ſelues, that we be no longer careleſſe of our eſtate: which muſt needes be, vntill that warning peece haue awakened vs and ſcared vs out of our ſelues.

But the doctrine of the Churche of Rome, offendeth bothe againſt his mercie, and iuſtice: aſcribing neither perfect mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, nor righteouſneſſe vnto God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="251" facs="tcp:7047:134"/>For it is no mercie to helpe him that hathe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerte in him ſelfe to be holpen, that is iuſtice.

            <p>We may conclude then, that in thoſe who haue begone in ſimplicitie and ſingleneſſe of heart to ſerue the Lorde, the lawe hathe great vſe: and the often ſight of themſelues therein, is verie ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie, not onely to be humbled vnder the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and vndeſeruedneſſe of his grace, but alſo vnder the greatneſſe of his goodneſſe: whiche

Therefore, to conclude this part: the lawe and commandements of God truely beholden and conſidered, do teache vs to giue vnto God, the honour that is due vnto him, as well for the free &amp; vndeſerued beginning, as for the free and vndeſerued continuing of his mercies towardes vs: that he that will glorie, may glorie in the Lorde.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, this vſe we haue of the lawe of God, that by it we are truely directed into the way of life, which of our ſelues we could neuer haue lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: and ſo, forewarned of theſe by-wayes of our owne deuiſing and deuotion, whiche leade vnto deſtruction.

            <p>The lawe therefore (being the will of our maiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter vttered from his owne mouthe) teacheth vs, truely and ſafely to ſerue him: and ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth vppe that daungerous pitte of our good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tente, deuotion, and good meaning: a daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous pitte to fall into at any time, but nowe moſte daungerous when we haue learned what is good deuotion and good meaning, euen from the Lords owne mouthe.</p>
            <p>There is alſo an other ſingular benefite whiche we haue by the lawe, and ſeueral commandements of God, which doeth remedie a miſchiefe that is ouer rife in theſe dayes. Many not of the worſte ſort of men, content themſelues generally to haue a liking of the word of God, and a general good meaning towarde his commaundementes, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer trauell to approue their heartes before GOD by profiting and goeing forwarde in the ſeuerall dueties of euerie ſeuerall commaundement whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che is well prouided for in the lawe, where wee are charged with ſeuerall dueties vnto GOD,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:7047:136"/>
and alſo vnto man: ſo as the neglecte of any due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ſett foorth by the lawe, redoundeth to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the Lord who is the lawgiuer. The often peruſing therfore of the ſeueral commandements, doe bring vs from chriſtianitie pretended in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall profeſſion and meaning vnto Chriſtianitie approued in particular practiſe of ſeuerall dueties: drawing that vaine generall profeſſion and liking vnto particular and ſeuerall well doeing. It were a lewde practiſe of a ſeruaunt, to pretend good li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of any thing that his maiſter ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde, yet neuer to put his hande painefully to the executing of his ſeuerall charge. There is nothing ſo common among many profeſſours of the worde, as to vpholde the credite of profeſſing the Goſpel, and fauouring it, not with careful fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing after the thinges giuen by name, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly in charge vnto them, but onely with their general liking or rather their not miſliking therof: as if this were good ſeruice, to giue our maiſter leaue to commaunde as ſeemed good vnto him, ſo wee might be at libertie to practiſe and doe as muche as like vs. It is a Chriſtians profeſſion to vpholde Gods honour, in what thing ſoeuer it is aſſaulted: &amp; there ſpecially where it is moſt aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in any, &amp; he moſt weak to reſiſt: which kind of warfare as it is the beſt, ſo is it well mainteyned by this light of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law.

power: whereby if there ſhalbe any care in vs, we ſhalbe prouoked to bring all the helpe that we haue or can come by, to that parte, to ſtrengthen it withall.</p>
            <p>For to what purpoſe were it, for vs (the eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies entring in at one parte of the houſe vppon vs,) to let goe the care of that, and there to keepe watche and warde, where there is no aſſault made againſt vs? As if ſathan ſhould ſore aſſault vs with couetouſneſſe, and labour to enter there, breakinge downe the walles of ſobrietie and temperaunce in theſe earthly profites, (whiche we ſhould vſe ſo ſoberly and temperantly as if we vſed them not: and wee doubting no harme from thence, ſhould conuert all our munition and defence, to vpholde the walles of gentleneſſe, loue, and meekeneſſe, when as in deede we are not aſſaulted with wrathe or diſpleaſure. Were not this a wofull kinde of warre, to lay open where we are aſſaulted: and to bee fenced on thoſe partes where we are not once attempted? Were not that a ſlender vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie, for that man to bragge, that he hath not one wound vpon his legges, whoſe heade and ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders haue borne off all?</p>
            <p>It cannot be denied, but many that goe for Chriſtians, boaſt themſelues greatly of ſuch kinde of victorie: that their legges are ſafe, becauſe ſome groſſe euils, as reuengement or plaine oppreſſion hathe not preuailed againſt them, when notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their head is yet bleeding with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtrokes

For the perfourmance wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, this portion of Scripture that now I haue read vnto you promiſeth verie muche.</p>
            <p>Wherein we may vnderſtande, that the firſte ſpring and founteine of our ſaluation is the loue of God. That is the firſt cauſe, the principal ground,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:7047:138"/>
and chiefe beginning of all our happineſſe, and therfore it is ſet down here as the cauſe why Chriſt was giuen for our ſinnes. <hi>So God loued the worlde,</hi> ſayth the texte, <hi>that he gaue his onely beegotten ſonne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The tender affection and loue of God towards vs, is placed before that great gift to commend the goodneſſe of it. For not ſo muche the gifte, as the minde of the giuer is wont to be conſidered. This is noted by the holy Ghoſt, with a ſpeciall note of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendation in theſe wordes.<note place="margin">1. Iohn. 4.10</note> 
               <hi>Herein is that loue, not that we loued God, but that he loued vs, and ſent his ſonne to bee a reconciliation for our ſinnes:</hi> Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in the Epiſtle to the Romanes.<note place="margin">Rom. 5.15.</note> There is ſet againſt the ſingle tranſgreſſion of Adam as an ouer matche, the grace of God, and the gifte in grace, or by grace. The benefite and medicine of Chriſte his obedience, was ſufficient for the wounde of Adam his tranſgreſſion, to make it whole withall: then remaineth as an aduantage or ouerplus, the grace and goodwill of the Father, wherin this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine was lapped and cloſed vp, which is the cauſe why he maketh a ſpecial note of the grace of God, and of the gifte in grace, or by grace. Theſe thinges are diligently to be obſerued: for they are the groundes of muche good doctrine that is eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed ſtrongly hereby.</p>
            <p>When we conſider what that was y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> firſt turned y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fauour of God towards vs, we may not begin at ourſelues, (as if it had come of our works preparing ourſelues for him, &amp; addreſſing ourſelues towards
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:7047:139"/>
his obedience) we may not beginne at our merites: nay, we may not beginne at the worke of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, and the merite of Chriſte, to make that the firſt thing that euer turned his heart towardes vs. For here it is affirmed by the holie Ghoſt that he loued vs, and therefore gaue his onely begotten ſonne for vs. When we come to the meriting of Chriſte, we muſt not looke vpon the vertue of it without the good will and fauour of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it was founded, and from whence it hathe the worthineſſe and merite that it hath. So farre off then are our owne works, from bringing their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerte with them, and opening by themſelues the gates of his goodneſſe: that the good will of God the father prepareth the way euen for the merite of Chriſte his paſſion. Our owne woorkes come ſhorte of beeing the firſt that hath commended vs vnto God, when bothe the good will of God the Father, and the merite alſo of Ieſus Chriſte haue beene there before them in our behalfe. Let men therefore ceaſſe to ſay or imagine that their owne woorkes were the firſte that euer ſpake one good worde for them, when it is ſo aſſured by the word of God that they haue had friendes in that courte that haue done for them when al the credit of their owne doeings was vtterly reiected and coulde not be heard. Whenſoeuer therefore we ſeeke out the chiefe cauſe and the firſt ſpring of our bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, let vs come to the loue of God.</p>
            <p>For it is ſaide, that <hi>God ſo loued the worlde that he
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:7047:139"/>
gaue his onely begotten ſonne, &amp;c.</hi> Let vs take heede of beginning at our ſelues, and our owne doinges. For (as hath beene ſaide) it was the loue of God that did begin all our bleſſedneſſe: yea, and that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen then, when we were enimies vnto him: and therefore farre from deſeruing any good thing at his hands: which thing co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendeth his loue, aboue all the loue and affection that is to be found in the worlde. For who hath euer beene knowen (the Sonne of God excepted) to giue his life for his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimies? Therefore doth the holy Ghoſte vppon iuſt cauſe affirme, that the loue of God towards vs, is herein ſette out and commended aboue all loue and affection that we haue heard of: becauſe while we were yet ſinners and enimies vnto him,<note place="margin">Rom. 5.8.</note> Chriſt died for vs.</p>
            <p>The ſcripture beareth recorde that Chriſte di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the vngodly: but (as it is there affirmed) hee is ſcarce to bee founde that will die for a good man. What good man hathe euer beene found that would haue ſuche compaſſion, as to offer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to die for a godleſſe perſon? The Sonne of God giueth his life for vngodly men. Meruell not at theſe wordes, neither thinke there is any thing too muche ſpoken in this matter. For in that Chapter it is ſaide plainely, that Chriſte died for the vngodly, for ſinners, for his enimies, and al to commend the greatneſſe of his loue. It will be graunted of all men, that in deede before the death and paſſion of Chriſt, we were godleſſe, vngodly, enimies to God, without any hope of a better life:
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:7047:140"/>
But all men are not perſuaded, that we doe nowe come ſuche men into the worlde and continue ſo: vntil by the ſpecial grace of God working with his worde we be reclaymed and refourmed, whiche (for that chaunge) is called regeneration or newe birthe. All men are not perſuaded, that when Chriſte beginneth Chriſtianitie in any, he doeth beginne with his enimie. Yet doeth the Apoſtle S. Paule affirme that he, as others, was by nature the childe of wrath,<note place="margin">Eph. 2.4.5.</note> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> before his calling he, as other men, was dead in treſpaſſes and ſinnes: walking af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the courſe of this worlde, after the ſpirite that woorketh in the children of diſobedience: but GOD (ſayth he) whiche is riche in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, throughe his great loue wherewith hee lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued vs, euen when we were dead by ſinnes, hathe quickened vs.</p>
            <p>There is no doubt of it, but that he who liueth the moſte blameleſſe life of all men in the worlde, is an enimie vnto God, and without all hope of any better life before this eſpeciall woorking and calling of GOD. I doe call Chriſtianitie a ſpeciall woorke of God, becauſe it is not to bee founde in the nature of any man, how great good thing ſoeuer it ſeeme to haue in it: but is a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar worke of GOD. This is a matter neede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to ſtande vppon, becauſe it giueth vnto God the commendation of that loue whiche is not to be matched in the worlde. And in denying this greateſt kinde of louing dealing, we darken and
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:7047:140"/>
diminiſhe the glorie of his mercie, appearing ſo clearely and ſo aboundantly herein: we deale vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankefully with GOD, not giuing vnto him all the praiſe that of duetie belongeth vnto him. If two ſeruauntes had receiued equall commodities and benefites of one maiſter, the one hauing beene a verie profitable ſeruaunt to his maiſter, the other a verie vnthrifte, and not onely not profitable, but alſo a waſter of his goods: ſhould the vnthrift ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently acknowledge the liberalitie of his maiſter, if he ſhould confeſſe that he had receiued as muche of him as his fellowe-ſeruaunt, making no menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the meane time of his vnworthineſſe in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of his fellowe?</p>
            <p>Euerie man ſeeth the good will of the maiſter, to appeare more in the one then in the other, and therefore he ſhould iuſtly bee accounted vnthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, if hee woulde not bothe thinke and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that he were more beholding to his maiſter then the other. For true thankefulneſſe cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the benefite receiued after a certeine manner to remaine ſtill in the benefactour, by thankefull remembraunce not onely of the gifte, but alſo of the maner and qualitie of the gifte: eſpecially when it addeth any thing to the worthineſſe and deſerte of the giuer.</p>
            <p>The cauſe therefore is great, and a parte of our thankfulneſſe vnto God is in it, to withſtand with the Churche of Rome herein, that not onely wee haue had theſe benefites that we haue from God,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:7047:141"/>
but alſo that wee haue had them contrarie to our deſeruing: which vtterly ouerthroweth thoſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes of preparation, and ſetting our ſelues in a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſſe for the Lorde, and maketh the benefite to remaine in God, by his iuſt praiſe, not only for the deede dooing, but alſo for tne mercifull maner of dealing with vnworthie men: wherin his loue is tryed to haue more in it, then any affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hath beene hearde of amongeſt men, that we may truly ſay with the holy Ghoſte, not only that God hath loued the worlde, but as it is ſaide in this place, <hi>So God loued the world,</hi> noting in that word <hi>(So)</hi> no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon affection, but the higheſt and greateſt degree of loue.</p>
            <p>By this that hathe beene ſaide before wee doe learne, that God did beare tender affection towards his, not onely before any deſeruing hadde gone before to procure the ſame: but alſo when as yet they were enimies vnto him, and therefore the Apoſtle in the Epiſtle to the Epheſians,<note place="margin">Eph. 1.3.4.7</note> bringeth the benefites of GOD to be conſidered in his free good purpoſe, and gratious good will towardes vs, beeing the head and ſpring thereof: whiche addeth greatly euen to the greateſt of his benefites. And if the conſideration thereof be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, the whole deſeruing of the benefactour is not acknowledged, nor deſerued praiſe rendered therevnto.</p>
            <p>When the Apoſtle had giuen praiſes vnto God the father of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte, for that he
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:7047:141"/>
had bleſſed vs with all ſpirituall bleſſinges in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly things in Chriſte: immediatly in the verſe following (which is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 4. in number) he hath theſe wordes: <hi>As he hath choſen vs in him before the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the worlde, &amp;c.</hi> As if his loue towards vs had not begonne then firſt, when thoſe benefites were beſtowed vpon vs, but that his good will (whereof thoſe were teſtimonies and fruites) was bent to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes vs, before the beginning of the worlde: whiche is the cauſe why he letteth vs to ſee thoſe fruites not barely in them ſelues alone, but in that good will which ſo long before was inclined to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vs. And good will the longer it hath conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, the more it is to be eſteemed: and the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites of an olde friend, and welwiller of long time, haue iuſt occaſion in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be the more accounted of. It is not to be merueyled then, why with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gift he bringeth in alſo the good will of the giuer. For the gifte is made thereby the greater, bothe for that the good will hath beene of long time continued, and alſo for that it is his goodwill onely, and not any thinge either had allready, or elſe hoped for from vs, that hath brought all theſe benefites vnto vs: as it followeth in the nexte verſe in expreſſe wordes: <hi>That he hath predeſtinate vs to bee adopted through Ieſus Chriſte, according to the good pleaſure of his will, by whome</hi> (as it is there in like manner affirmed) <hi>we haue redemption through his bloud, euen the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, according to his riche grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In all theſe places we are let to vnderſtand, that all our benefites, euen the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:7047:142"/>
came from the good pleaſure of his will, and the riches of his grace, and not (as hath beene ſaide be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) from any thing of ours, either had already, or elſe hoped for. Let vs learne therefore to ſet his loue before all his benefites, as the only cauſe and ſpring therof. For if we ſhall beginne at our ſelues, to ſay that either that which already wee had, as a towardenes and preparation to goodneſſe: or that whiche God did forſee would bee in vs, was the cauſe why the Lorde hath appointed euerlaſting life for vs, and giuen vs the graces that apperteine there vnto: we darken and diminiſh the greatneſſe and goodneſſe of the gifte. Whiche cannot be ſo commendable, if it come for the deſerte of bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites, either had already, or elſe hoped for: as if it had beene ſent from the frank and free good will of the giuer, without any ſuch reſpect of any thing that ſhould proceede from vs. This is the reaſon why the loue of God is heere ſet before the gifte of the mediatour and redeemer Ieſus Chriſte: and alſo why the benefite of election and all other, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt cap. to the Epheſians are alwayes coupled to the good will of God. For we are giuen to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that the good things which are ſuppoſed to be in vs, doe turne his heart, &amp; purchaſe his fauour towards vs: when in very deede his good wil to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes vs, brought all thoſe graces, &amp; all the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes that we haue vnto vs. In ſomuch that both our election and redemption are recited to the Ephe.<note place="margin">Ephe. 1.</note> to haue proceeded from the free good wil of God, and are made not as matters purchaſing it: but as mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:7047:142"/>
purchaſed of it. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this free goodwil of God is not acknowledged to be the beginning of all his giftes, his giftes muſt of all men y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are ſo perſuaded be leſſe eſteemed. For it is the minde and goodwil of the giuer that doth commend the gift, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it to be alwayes the better accepted. Men are wont not to eſteme the gift ſo much, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> minde of the giuer. Therefore the doctrine of the churche of Rome hath and doth meruelouſly pull away from the benefites of God and the deſeruings therof: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it doth not eſteme of them as fruites of a well willing minde towardes vs, and of ſuche a one as-already liketh well of vs: becauſe that doctrine profeſſeth that thoſe giftes of his in vs, by our vſe thereof do firſt turne his fauourable countenaunce to vs-ward. Moreouer, becauſe that loue was bent towards vs, when we were bent as enimies againſt him: which maketh his loue ſo great y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it may iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be ſaid of it, <hi>So God loued the world,</hi> as being a rare kinde of loue, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> like whereof we haue not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en. Therfore that doctrin of the church of Rome y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> giueth vnto man workes of preparation, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of him ſelfe fit to meete God &amp; to ioine with him in the purchaſe of his happineſſe, darckeneth greatly this great degree of his loue that was ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vnto vs, when we were ſo farre from preparing our ſelues to mete with him for our ſaluation, that we were vtter enimies both vnto him and vnto it. Which is ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fortable vnto thoſe that are truely turned vnto him, that it is the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

            <p>It hath beene declared at large, why the greate loue of GOD is ſet before the benefite of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, and the greate gifte of Ieſus Chriſte giuen vnto vs?

This is the cauſe of this diuerſitie, and none other thing. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apoſtle proueth that the teſtimonie of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſte was confirmed amongſt the Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans becauſe they abounded in all knowledge.<note place="margin">1.

            </p>
            <p>And here by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> way, it is manifeſt that ignorance is not mother, but ſtepmother vnto deuotion and true Chriſtianitie. For Chriſt is made vnto Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians of God the father wiſedome, teaching them the knowledge of his word and wil. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, if it ſhould be demanded why in their religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and ſeruing of God, ſome followe the inuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

of man (which hath in it great ſhew of holines,<note place="margin">Col. .2.</note> in humbleneſſe of mind, not ſparing the body, but laying much affliction vppon it: in doeing many thinges vnto God voluntarily, not beeing bound vnto it by him, but frankly and freely of their own accorde.) And another ſorte (contenting them ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues with the bare and naked ſimplicitie of Gods worde, in the worſhipping and ſeruing of him) do condemne and vtterly reiect all thoſe inuentions of men and ſhewes of holineſſe and humblenes of minde, which ſtandeth ſo ſtrongly vpon the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and reaſon of man: the matter is plaine and the aunſwere ſoone made, <hi>Chriſte is made of GOD the father wiſedome vnto his.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the cauſe why his ſeruantes finde no wiſedome but in him. This is the reaſon why it ſeemeth madnes and extreme follie vnto his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants whatſoeuer is not approued by his worde, haue it neuer ſo ſtrong reaſons of mans wit to vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde it withall. It is not their wiſdome: they can ſee no witt in it. For Chriſte is become wiſedome vnto them, and they haue learned no ſuche thinge of him in his word. Therefore it is their wiſedome to reiect ſuch wiſedome.</p>
            <p>It is a merueylous thinge, that any man who hath wit and reaſon, ſhould miſlike that religion which hath nothing elſe in it but force of witt, and ſtrength of reaſon. But let vs ceaſſe to meruaile, and beginne to magnifie the goodnes of that God, who vouchſafeth to become wiſedome vnto his, teaching them in his worde another manner of
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:7047:144"/>
wiſedome, then that whiche is taught them of ther owne wit and reaſon.</p>
            <p>Here ye ſee then the firſt benefite that commeth with Chriſte vnto his, euen wiſdome in his word. Doe we meane to approue it before God &amp; man, that we are called vnto the fellowſhippe of Chriſt, and become Chriſtians in deede? Let vs then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come wiſe after his worde. Let vs giue ouer our owne witt and reaſon in the gouerneing of our liues either towarde God or man, and betake vs to his worde, who is become our wiſedome.

            <p>Chriſte (as you ſee) at his firſt comming chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth our wiſedome: this is his worke.

We can approue and like in our iudgement no good thinge, before our iudgement be good.

Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> queſtion is then whervpon ariſeth this diuerſitie of iudgementes in men, that one perſuadeth him ſelfe that the cauſe why hee is acceptable to God, firſt ſpringeth of him ſelfe, and an other number denyeth all that is in him ſelfe, to haue beene any cauſe to make him accepted vnto God, and dothe attribute y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole cauſe why he is acceptable vnto God vnto the righteouſnes of Ieſus Chriſt, which is become theirs by fayth? from hence wee haue an aunſwere that may ſatiſfie vs, whiche is, that Chriſte is made righteouſneſſe vnto his. It is the worke of Chriſt in them, to aſſure them to bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted for the righteouſneſſe of an other, and to giue ouer all the holde that they haue, by the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of any thing that they ſhall haue doone them ſelues. Our naturall wit and reaſon can not allow of that. It is apparant therefore, that wee haue an other ſcholemaiſter that doth teache vs this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine. Can one man for his good workes that he hath done, ſtand ſo ſtrongly aſſured in his opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſaluation, and to bee accepted for them, that hee ſhall offer his ouerplus to helpe other withall: and an other man (that is not inferiour vnto this other, neyther in wit, reaſon, nor good deedes) ſo giue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer all the hope of them, that in flat deniall and vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter renouncing thereof, he ſhould lay clayme only

to the righteouſneſſe that an other hath done, and boaſt of that none otherwiſe, then if he ſhuld haue done it in his owne perſon? Can this I ſay be tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ught reaſonable vnto any, that hath not had an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſcholmaiſter then wit and reaſon to perſuade him therein? Can the naturall man bee perſuaded that he muſt firſt be righteous, and then do righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous things: and not rather that in doing of many righteous deedes, at length hee becommeth to bee accepted for righteous him ſelfe thereby? Or can a naturall man bee perſuaded, that his fauour with God commeth wholy in reſpect of an other his doings, who hath done him all this good: and not rather that his owne doings haue done the moſte for him, and he that is eſpecially beholding vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them? This commeth from an other teacher then any that wee haue at home: it ſauoureth not of the earth, it is from aboue. Ceaſſe therefore to maruell at ſuche diuerſitie of doctrine, when the ſcholemaiſters that teach are ſo farre differing one from an other, as heauen is from earth. The ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntes of God giue ouer their owne righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, they finde nothing in it: they doe clearely ſee it will not goe for payment, and therefore doe betake themſelues to the merites of an other.

When wee beginne to ſeparate our ſelues from the common corruption of the worlde, and bend our ſelues to pureneſſe of life approued before God, this is the worke of Chriſte, ſanctifying and working true holineſſe in vs. For of our ſelues we are prophane and vnholy, voyde of theſe fruites of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe whiche are wrought in vs by Chriſte.

            <p>Heere their aunſwere is, we are iuſtified with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oute woorkes going before, but not withoute workes folowing it, making this iuſtification that is ſaide to be without woorkes, to ſhut out onely thoſe woorkes that are before a man be iuſtified, but not the other. For their opinion is, that wee are iuſtified by them, wherevpon it followeth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily, that righteouſneſſe goeth before holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of life, that good workes do followe from a man iuſtified alreadie: and are not ſent before to iuſtifie him therewith, that was not accepted of God as righteous, vntill thoſe were perfourmed.

And Abraham beleeued the Lord, and he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted that to him for righteouſneſſe.</hi> By this teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie we ſee that Abraham was accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted righteous, &amp; not in part righteous, or half righteous, but with out any addition it was ſayde of him, that he was righteous (before he had any ſonne, and therefore before he could offer vp his ſonne in ſacrifice, euen then, when he made complaint vnto God for that he had no ſonne, and therefore a ſeruaunt muſt bee his heire) beleuing the promiſe that the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was made vnto him for a ſeede and poſteritie that ſhoulde come out of his owne loynes, that fayth was rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned vnto him for righteouſneſſe, and hee him ſelfe accepted of, as righteous before the Lorde. Iames ſayth, that hee was iuſtified when his owne ſonne Iſaac was offered vppon the altar, and that this deede of his, in not refuſing to kill his onely ſonne for a ſacrifice at the commaundement of God, did ſo pleaſe the Lorde, that he was iuſtified for it. In the other place alledged, the holy Ghoſt affirmeth, that hee was iuſtified before his ſonne Iſaac was borne, euen at that time when the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe was giuen forth that he ſhould haue a ſonne, and that the beleeuing of this good will of God towardes him herein did ſo pleaſe the Lorde, that he accounted of him as righteous for it. Howe then? Doth the holy Ghoſt differ from him ſelfe? God forbid. But the Apoſtle Sainte Iames attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buteth that to the effect for being ioyned with his
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:7047:149"/>
cauſe, which the holy ghoſt in that other place gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vnto the true and originall cauſe alone. As if one man wold iuſtifie a workman, and commend him aboue others for workes that hee hath ſeene him do, and an other would in like manner iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the ſame, but for the inward skill, knowledge, and conceiuing that he hath of the rules and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of that trade or occupation what ſo euer: which skill he may diſcerne by his ſpeache, albeit he neuer ſawe him worke. And albeit a man may ſay that he is a good workman, bicauſe his worke is good, yet if a man wil ſpeake properly, he muſt ſay he is a good workeman, bycauſe his skill is good. For his good skill in that trade, is the cauſe of his good workmanſhippe, and the goodneſſe thereof commeth from thence as from the proper founteine and cauſe.</p>
            <p>Nowe euerie man knoweth that when any man is commended for his worke, it is bycauſe of the skill and knowledge that appeareth therein, and is ioyned therewith, as the onely cauſe and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion thereof: Euen ſo, bycauſe our fayth appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in our good woorkes, as our skilfull know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge dothe in our skilfull workmanſhip: that is giuen to good woorkes, which is peculiar vnto fayth, as the proper cauſe thereof, and a man ſhall bee called a skilfull woorkman for his skilfull workmanſhip, when notwithſtanding it is moſt aſſured, that his skilfull knowledge is before his skilfull woorke, as alſo the cauſe thereof: and hee iuſtly may be called skilfull for it, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:7047:150"/>
he ſhould bee kept from vttering that his skill in worke many yeres after the perfect knowledge thereof.</p>
            <p>The holie Ghoſt therefore in Geneſis, iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Abraham as skilfull for his skill alone: and in that epiſtle of Iames he iuſtifieth him, as skilful of that worke wherein ſo much skil appeared. For it may be lawfull vnto me for the better vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding hereof, to reſemble fayth by skill, and good deedes by skilfull workmanſhippe, bycauſe as good workmanſhip hath all the commendation for the good skill that appeareth in it: ſo haue good woorkes all their praiſe from the fayth that hath begotten them, and is neceſſarily ioyned with them.</p>
            <p>This is alſo to be added, that bycauſe there is not in our workes that perfection that is required, we are conſtreyned to ſtand to the mercie of God, and to ſeeke refuge there by a true fayth: and this is the cauſe why we magnifie faith, (which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe is imperfect as be all things that are in vs) bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it applieth the mercy of God vnto vs, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by our ſinnes are pardoned, and the want that is in our worke not imputed.</p>
            <p>And for proofe that the Apoſtle Sainte Iames giueth not that title vnto woorkes to iuſtifie, but bycauſe of the fayth whiche hath begotte thoſe workes, and which is ioyned with them, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereth the imperfections that is in them: in the ſame place where he aſcribeth righteouſneſſe vnto Abraham for offering vp his ſonne, hee ſayth that

this ſcripture was fulfilled: Abraham beleeued, and it was reckoned vnto him for righteouſneſſe, and he was called the friende of God: So that all the commendation of this woorke is included in faith, and giuen vnto it for the fayth of the doer. For other wiſe hee ſhould haue ſayde: Abraham wrought, and that was receiued bycauſe it was righteous, ſeeing hee had ſtoode vppon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of his workes ſo muche immediately before, and was eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> yet in the ſame matter. But he ſayth, Abraham beleeued, and that was reckoned vnto him for righteouſneſſe.</p>
            <p>They would match workes with faith in iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and the Apoſtle when hee ſpeaketh moſt of works, doth ſhrowd them vnder fayth, ſaying: (after mention of his beſt woorke) that this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was fulfilled in it: Abraham beleeued, and that was imputed to him for righteouſneſſe, and not receiued in the righteouſneſſe and deſeruing of it ſelfe, and he was called the friend of God.</p>
            <p>And in the eleuenth Chapter to the Hebrues,<note place="margin">Hebr. 11.</note> all the woorkes of the godly fathers are aſcribed vnto fayth, and by name in the ſeuenteenth verſe of that Chapter, this deede of Abraham is fathered vpon his faith. For workes are ſo farre from iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying vs, that the cauſe why they them ſelues are iuſtified, is in fayth.<note place="margin">Hebr. 11.6</note> 
               <hi>For without fayth it is impoſſible to pleaſe God.</hi> And in this chiefe worke of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham that nowe wee haue heard of, that Scripture of imputing righteouſneſſe vnto him, was fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="284" facs="tcp:7047:151"/>Therefore the worke did not ſtande in any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for the worthineſſe thereof, but onely by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Lorde did impute it vnto him for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe: which thing alſo it did not attaine vnto of it ſelfe, but bycauſe of fayth whiche was ioyned with it. It is to be noted, that the Apoſtle Sainte Iames ſpeaketh here but of one woorke (as the offering vp of his ſonne) and that woorke alſo not done, but onely purpoſed to be done. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his meaning had beene to debate the worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of woorkes, and what place they haue in the purchaſe of our ſaluation, hee would haue taken woorkes not onely purpoſed, but alſo practiſed: not ſome one worke alone, but many works long continued.</p>
            <p>Neyther would he haue ſayde of that or thoſe works, that they were imputed vnto him for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, but that they wrought his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, eyther wholy or at the leaſt in part. But the purpoſe of the apoſtle is to ſignifie, that a true faith is fruitfull in good works, and is witneſſed by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and that it is impoſsible that a true fayth ſhould not be rich in good workes, or that righteouſneſſe ſhould be without holineſſe of life. For it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſsible that we receiuing comfort in his mercies by fayth, ſhould not witneſſe the ſame by a life framed to the liking of him of whome wee haue thoſe comforts.</p>
            <p>The laſt of theſe benefites that we receiue by Chriſte is Redemption, that is, the deliuerie from all daunger, affliction, and corruption.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="285" facs="tcp:7047:151"/>It is the fruite of his reſurrection to raiſe vs out of all extremities euen from death and the graue, and to place vs with his Saintes in that glory that hee hath purchaſed for vs.<note place="margin">Rom. 8.23 Ephe. 1.14.</note> Thus is redemption taken for our fredome and deliuerie from our wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. For we hold not with the aduerſaries of god his grace, that our good deeds do redeeme vs from the daunger of our euill doings: neyther yet that by prayers or ſatiſfaction whatſoeuer, we can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer eyther our ſelues or other from the daunger in this life, and much leſſe in the life to come. We confeſſe, that howſoeuer we humble our ſelues by repentance, prayers, and fruits of good liuing, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his rod of correction is vppon vs, that it is onely the free benefite of Chriſte, to deliuer from the daunger thereof, and to put an happie end vnto it. Wee doe not thanke our deedes for it when wee come foorth of trouble, albeit that we haue plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully brought foorth the fruites of good life. We acknowledge it to be onely the worke of Chriſt, who is made of God the father vnto vs <hi>redemption,</hi> to deliuer vs from ſinne, and all thoſe puniſhments y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> come vnto man for it. In this benefite of Chriſt there appeareth a great difference betweene y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God and the children of this world. For the children of God glory in trouble, knowing that it will bring vpon them experience, and tryal of god his goodneſſe in the ende, as the Apoſtle teacheth vs.<note place="margin">Rom. 5.4</note> For Chriſt is made vnto them redemption fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſinne and all the puniſhments thereof: whereas the vngodly (howe ſo euer in proſperitie they fleſhly

bragge of their hope in God. Yet when affliction commeth, they are without all heart, comforte, or courage. For why, in truth they knowe not that Chriſt is made redemption vnto them, to deliuer them from all that danger that commeth for ſinne as well as from ſinne it ſelfe. This perſuaſion cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the godly in all their afflictions and neceſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties whatſoeuer, to ſtay them ſelues in godly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation, both towarde God and man, with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and aſſured hope of an happie ende: when as the vngodly eyther murmur againſt God, eyther elſe fall into ſome one euill dealing or other, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to purchaſe their deliueraunce, which is an aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red teſtimonie that they doe not looke to haue it from the Lord.</p>
            <p>Nowe wee haue heard what ſeuerall benefites do come with Chriſt, and that we do not receyue him naked and alone, but according as he is giuen vnto vs from God the father, clothed with wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, righteouſneſſe, holineſſe, and redemption. Thus is he giuen vnto the beleeuers, and thus is he receiued of the beleeuers. And heereby wee may clearely vnderſtand what faith is, euen that which findeth all want in it ſelfe, and al plentie in Chriſt: that is poore at home, and rich abroad: that in her neceſsitie boaſteth, and is comfortable in an other mans plentie: that neuer reſteth in her ſelfe nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing of her own, (haue ſhe neuer ſo great plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in reſpect of others) and yet is ioyfull, comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and well payde and ſatiſfied with Chriſte in her greateſt want. For faith is not ſo highly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:7047:152"/>
as it is a worke of ours, for ſo it is imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect as all others be that come from vs: but bicauſe it giueth all glorie from vs vnto God. Therfore hath it ſo iuſt commendation in the woorde of God, wee giue the moſt vnto it, bicauſe it giueth nothing vnto vs, that God may haue all glorie, and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he that will glorie, may glorie in the Lord. We doe not exalt it aboue other thinges that proceede from vs, bycauſe it doth exalte vs, but bycauſe it doth abaſe vs, that Chriſt may be exalted, therefore do we magnifie it. For faith findeth perfection in God, and imperfection in vs. Fayth findeth true wiſedome to be in Chriſt, charging all the worlde with follie in their wit, (bee they neuer ſo wiſe in the opinion of men) before they be lightened with the vnderſtanding of his wiſedome ſet foorth in his worde. Fayth findeth true righteouſneſſe in Chriſt alone, and chargeth all men with vnrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe in them ſelues, as withered braunches proceeding out of the rotten ſtocke of Adam their firſt father, vntil we be grafted into Chriſt the root of all righteouſneſſe.</p>
            <p>Faith findeth true ſanctification and holineſſe of life in Chriſt, and chargeth all men howe ciuily and honeſtly ſo euer they liue in the iudgement of men, to bee of a prophane and vnholy nature and diſpoſition, except they haue it refourmed by ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall grace from Chriſt. Faith findeth deliuerance from all daunger in Chriſt, and chargeth the deeds of all men, with want of abilitie in that behalfe.</p>
            <p>Thus we learne, that fayth doth finde all thoſe
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:7047:153"/>
things in Chriſt, and the want of euerie one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the nature of man: nay, which worſſe is, a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfet of euerie one of them deepely imprinted in vs: a counterfet wiſedome of man his wit and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention, for the true wiſdome of his word: coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfet righteouſneſſe of our corrupt works, for the true righteouſneſſe brought and wrought by Chriſt alone: a feined deuotion grounded by our owne good intent, for holineſſe, and ſanctification of life and well doing, guided and directed by his worde: a falſe perſuaſion to auoyde daungers by our owne ſatiſfactions, in ſtead of an aſſured ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his redemption, and deliuerie in all our ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsitie and wantes. Theſe are the withered bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of that rotten roote our olde Adam: and the nature and diſpoſition of all men goeth this way, except they be reclaymed by Chriſt, as all thoſe be (in his appointed time) that ſhal inherite with him in his kingdome. In as much as we do clearely vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand what is in vs, before that Chriſt ſhall call vs: it ſhall be profitable to conſider whether (after that Chriſt hath layde clayme vnto his, and giuen them that in truth which before they had in ſhew) fayth doth yet finde any ſuch want and lacke, that (notwithſtanding ſuch a chaunge) it reſteth onely in Chriſt, and refuſeth to ſtand to any deſart whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che this newe obedience can clayme. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is plaine, that fayth findeth lacke and want in man, notwithſtanding that hee be chaunged and renued by Chriſte, from that he was before, and come to that perfection that euer any man hath at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:7047:153"/>
vnto. This wil appeare moſt plainely in the conſideration of thoſe ſeuerall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities whiche (as we lerned before) ar brought with Chriſt. We that be Chriſts, do receiue wiſdome from Chriſt, yet is there want of wiſedome in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> childe of God that hath receiued the greateſt portion thereof,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 13.12</note> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as it is written to the Corinthes. <hi>Now we ſe in a glaſſe darckly, but then ſhall we ſee face to face. Now I knowe in parte, but then ſhall I knowe euen as I am kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen.</hi> We that be Chriſtes do receiue righteouſnes from him by faith, but we haue ſuch wantes in our faith while we be here, that this is the prayer of the Church and euery member therof, ſo long as they liue: <hi>Lord increaſe our faith: I beleeue, Lorde helpe mine vnbeliefe.</hi> We receiue ſanctification and holineſſe of life from Chriſte, but in that meaſure: that it is the continuall prayer of the church vnto the ende, <hi>Forgiue vs our trespaſſes, as we do forgiue them that treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe againſt vs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The faithful that haue bene deliuered from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny dangers already by Chriſte, who is their rede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, haue yet for all that many dangers &amp; troubles abiding for them: inſomuch that it is thus written of the eſtate of them:<note place="margin">Rom. 8.36.</note> 
               <hi>For thy ſake are we killed all the day long, we are accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted as ſheepe for the ſlaughter.</hi> And if they ſhould eſcape all other, yet death will ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly haue to doe with them al at the laſt, and wil not reſigne her right vnto any. Theſe are plain proofes that the faithfull neuer ſtande ſatiſfied with any thing in them ſelues, as beeing perfect in it, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes returne vnto their mediatour and redeemer
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:7047:154"/>
Chriſte, where is the perfection of that whiche in ſmall meaſure abideth in them ſelues: who hath theſe thinges ſo perfect in him ſelfe, not for him ſelfe, but for vs: and therefore the holy Ghoſt doth not ſay (which notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding in truth he might) that Chriſt hath made vs wiſe, righteous, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, but he ſayth that Chriſt is made vnto vs wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, righteouſnes and holines, adding the cauſe thereof in theſe wordes folowing: <hi>That he that will glorie, may glorie in the Lorde.</hi> For faithe refuſeth to glorie of any thing in it ſelfe, finding wante in all things: that it may glorie in the Lord alone. For it is no praiſe worthie of him, if hee be but fellowe with vs in the worke, but when we are truely ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken (as we are in deede) for nothing, and that that commeth from vs as no ſufficient payment, then receiueth the Lord the whole right of his glorie, which otherwiſe is cleane darckened, when it is made to patch vp that which we had begunne. Let vs therefore neuer forget this, that we doe mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie faith aboue all that which doth come from vs, not ſimply, becauſe it faſteneth harde vppon Chriſte: but becauſe it ſo taketh holde vpon him, that it letteth go all the holde that it hath of any thing in it ſelfe. We may not therefore onely conſider whether we haue any ſtay in Chriſt: but whether we haue ſuch a ſtay, that acknowledgeth vs vnſtayed in our ſelues, and therefore to be vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden by him alone. For faith ioyneth riches to pouertie, &amp; bringeth plentie vnto the emptie man.</p>
            <p>Nowe let vs pray vnto our heauenlie father, that his true faith may be increaſed in vs. &amp;c. Amen.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E haue learned already what faith is, and therfore order doth require to ſpeake ſomewhat of prayer, beeing ſuche a fruite and effect therof, as cannot be parted from it. For as faith is weake or ſtrong, ſo are prayers colde or carefull, ſparing or plentifull, becauſe true prayer receiueth life from faith, which without it is dead &amp; nothing worth. And becauſe faith quickneth prayers, we may tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly iudge of faith by our praiers, cold prayers, colde faith, few prayers, little faith, they increaſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay together, they ariſe and ſpring vp both at one time. In this treatiſe of prayer, before I ſhall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the petitions, that is, what things are to bee aſked, it ſhalbe very profitable to ſpeake ſomwhat before, neceſſarie for the preparing of vs thervnto.</p>
            <p>Heerein the firſte thing to bee conſidered is, the vſe and end of prayer, whiche is to bring vs to ſuche tryall and experience of Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe towardes vs: as may force vs in trueth to honour and praiſe him. For we cannot hartily honour &amp; praiſe him, of whoſe goodneſſe toward vs we haue no certeine knowledge. And how ſhall we haue certeine knowledge and true tryall of his
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:7047:155"/>
goodneſſe towardes vs, but by receiuing and taſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof: and how can we ſtand better aſſured what we haue receiued, then by finding that giuen vs, which we knowe and well remember that we haue aſked and begged before at his hands in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er? So that prayer leadeth vs to this certeine and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured knowledge of God his good meaning to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vs, which is the founteine of all true ſeruice and praiſe of God: while prayer goeth in euery neceſſitie to trie for it ſelfe the goodneſſe of God promiſed in his word, and bringeth with it a true certificate and good experience thereof, in that his ſute is graunted and he in his prayer is comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. And this aſſura<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of God his particular regard and fauour towards vs, bringeth with it a ſeruing and honouring of God in trueth. And therefore Solomon rendereth this reaſon why he wold haue the Lord to graunt the petition y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his ſeruants ſhuld pray for:<note place="margin">1. Kin. 8.40</note> 
               <hi>That</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>they may feare thee as long as they liue.</hi> It is his reaſon alſo why he would haue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtraunger (which was not of the people of Iſrael) heard in all that he called for: that all the people of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> earth might know his name, &amp; ſerue him as did his people Iſrael. For it is this aſſured knowledge of a ſpeciall good will of God towards vs, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth our hartes to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true worſhipping of him. All men knowe that God is good, but all men knowe not that he is good vnto them. All beleeue that he is good, but all beleeue not that hee is good vnto them, yet is that the true faithe, and therefore is prayer a true fruit of faith y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> confirmeth vs therin:
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:7047:155"/>
according as the Prophet Dauid teſtifieth of him ſelfe,<note place="margin">Pſal. 116.1.</note> that he loued the Lord becauſe he had heard his prayers.</p>
            <p>Our faithe hath neede of all the helpes that can bee, to ſtrengthen it withall in temptations, and therefore this tryall of it, (when wee receiue comforte of our prayers, hauing his good will brought home vnto vs, and therefore by ſo good experience aſſured vs, that we can ſhew good eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for it) is not to be neglected but highlie to be accounted of. If God haue made vs many promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to help vs in our neceſſities, and wee ſhall not once haue ſent our prayer to make tryall thereof: can we haue any greate hope at our neede of his helpe, hauing no holde but by his bare promiſes, which long time before were made vnto vs, but neuer tryed by vs to haue any truethe in them?</p>
            <p>Let vs not tempte the Lord, in differring this ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gthening of our faith, which hath need of al the vpholding that may be had: and all wil be tryed in tryall to be little inough. It behoueth vs to looke vp our euidence, for we deale with that aduerſarie that neither wanteth ſkill to eſpye his aduauntage, nor wil to holde it to the vttermoſte: and prayer is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which bringeth tryall of God his good wil to vs particularly, in that by prayer wee are comforted and releeued whenſoeuer we ſhal open our griefes and wants vnto our God. For albeit the Lorde might giue it vs without aſking, yet it is his will that we ſhould aſke, that we may knowe wee haue beene heard: and by that meanes receiue aſſurance
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:7047:156"/>
of his goodwil towards vs. It hath bene ſaid before that it is one thinge to be perſuaded that God is good: and another to be perſuaded that he is good to vs, it is one thing to be perſuaded y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> God giueth all things, and an other that he giueth them to vs as a pledge of his ſpeciall goodwill and meaning to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vs. The faith of God his childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> perſuadeth them of goodwil from the Lord, ment particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: and in their prayers they receiue in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde benefites no otherwiſe: but as ſpeciall to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens of his fauour, who now is atone with them &amp; tenderly doth imbrace them. And y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed prayer to be a helpe vnto our faith in this parte, that a man obteining by aſking, might know that he were of ſome reckoning with the Lorde: and might bring out this proofe againſt thoſe te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations that ſhould ſhake his faith, in calling it into queſtion whether he were regarded of the Lord or otherwiſe. We ſee that Dauid ſtrengtheneth his faith in the hope to be heard for his preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſuite,<note place="margin">Pſal. 4.1.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Lord had confirmed his good-will to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward him in hearing his prayers before. Sure it is that if the Lord wil giue vs things vnaſked, muche more wil he giue vs y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which we haue intreted him for. And if we get no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forte that way, our hope is ſmall. This help of our miſtruſtful diſpoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that we ſhould come by benefites through intreatie and prayer (where wee may plainely ſee that we are greatly regarded &amp; not without reckoning before him, in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he vouchſafeth to anſwere vs in our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions made vnto him for our welfare) is a ſingular vſe and end of prayer, which merueilouſly addeth
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:7047:156"/>
to the force of faith. This ſingular vſe &amp; ſpecial end of prayer are they depriued of that vſe to pray vnto God in an vnknowen tong. For if any particular benefit be giuen them, they knowe not whether it hath come at their intreatie or no, becauſe they knowe not what they haue prayed for: &amp; ſo receiue they no ſure &amp; cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine teſtimonie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lords help. It is a ſingular bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, to haue his goodneſſe towards vs particularly in aſſured experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. It wil be anſwered for them y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> pray in an vnknowen tong, that it ſkilleth not though they them ſelues know not what they pray, in aſmuch as God knoweth all things: and therfore vnderſtandeth it. This anſwere were to ſome purpoſe, if the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of prayer were in regarde of God alone without conſideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of vs, but prayer is appointed (as we haue already heard) y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> our weakenes of faith might haue as it were ſenſible hold therby, &amp; ſuch as would ſuffer no exception to the contrarie, in that wee haue felt him help vs there wherein we haue requeſted his helpe by name &amp; ſpeciall requeſt: ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there hath bene friendly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municating together, we aſking, and he giuing that which we haue aſked: we requiring, and he ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing vnto y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> requeſt. As for thoſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> pray in a tong vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen, how can they aſſuredly know that he fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting that which they haue required? when they knowe not what it is y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they aſked, and therfore their faith doth receiue no ſtrength by their prayer y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> can ſtand in any triall. This vſe alſo of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er which conſiſteth in bringing helpe to our faith, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proueth thoſe that pray onely in ſome vniuerſall ſpeeche, and doe neuer particularly and by name offer to God the redres of any thing that doth vexe them.
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:7047:157"/>
The example may be this: ſome onely in generall words vſe to pray y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> God would bleſſe them, or y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> God would make them his ſeruants, or y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he would kepe euil fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them. But they are not accuſtomed to pray for his bleſſing in any ſpeciall cauſes whiche they are deſtitute of: neither come they to God, to craue his grace to ſerue him in this or that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar obedience, wherevnto they are bounde, and yet knowe themſelues to be wanting therein, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore can they ſee no ſpeciall fruite of their prayers to helpe their faithe with all. We doe ſee then apparantly, that this fruite and effecte of prayer, to ſtrengthen our faith in the perſuaſion of God his good will towardes vs: is a meruelous profitable meane to incourage vs to prayer, beeing ſo ſtrong a fortreſſe of our faith.</p>
            <p>The ſeconde thing that is to be required of him that ſhall pray in trueth, is, to beare a good affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and heartie loue and good will to the worde of God, to ſee the Lord honoured thereby, either in dueties commaunded of him, and perfourmed: or elſe in promiſes made by him, and fulfilled, The Lorde reigneth by his word, and his honour is acknowledged when that is reuerenced, hee is magnified when it is obeyed, he is iuſtified and honoured when thinges fall out according to the trueth of his word. For by his word hath he made himſelfe knowen alwayes,<note place="margin">2. Peter.</note> and by that as he made the worlde, ſo hathe he appointed to gouerne and iudge y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world, making himſelf glorious in perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> trueth therof. And therfore we ſeeking his
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:7047:157"/>
glorie and honour in our prayers, as we muſt do, (if we ſhall pray to any purpoſe,) muſte ioyne with his worde in them, either praying to haue ſome grace giuen vs, to walke in ſome duetie that he hath commaunded, that in that duetie he may be honoured: or elſe in our affliction to finde ſome comfort: (according as he hathe promiſed,) that he in the trueth of his promiſe may be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified.</p>
            <p>And becauſe the prayer that is approued muſt proceede from the deſire of the heart, longing and luſting after that which in prayer he deſireth: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is there in the hearts of them that pray aright, a loue, liking, and heartie affection, that longeth hungerly after the righteouſneſſe and trueth of the worde to ſee it eſtabliſhed and vpholden: &amp; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after that dutie or promiſe, that in his prayer he deſireth to haue perfourmed. As there is loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde the lawe where true prayer is, ſo is there griefe and myſliking for the tranſgreſſing of the lawe to be found in like manner within his heart, that prayeth in trueth vnto the Lorde. For if the keeping of the lawe be vnto any his delighte, the tranſgreſſing of the lawe in like manner muſt bee his griefe. It is plaine then, that true prayer muſt not onely be directed by the lawe and commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, but alſo muſt ioyne in deſire and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection with the ſame.</p>
            <p>The glorie of God is coupled to his word, and therfore muſt praiers (being the deſire of the heart) goe in deſire after the ſame, according as we haue
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:7047:158"/>
the example and practiſe of the Prophet Dauid at large in the Pſalmes,<note place="margin">Pſalme. 119.</note> where it is apparanr that hee placeth all the honour of God in his word, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times praying to haue his petitions graunted that he might keepe his commandementes, ſome times taking comfort, &amp; aſſuring himſelfe that he ſhould he heard, becauſe he had a loue vnto his law: plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirming (as appeareth in that Pſalme) that ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation is far from the vngodly becauſe they ſeeke not his ſtatutes,<note place="margin">Verſ. 155.</note> wherein his glorie conſiſteth: as we may learne if we goe no further for profe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, then vnto the Lords prayer it ſelfe. For after mention made of hallowing of his name, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of his kingdome: there followeth the requeſt of doing his will here in earthe: becauſe his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, glorie, and dominion is ſeene in the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to his will reuealed in his worde.</p>
            <p>Herein we may clearely ſee ſentence giuen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all ſuch prayers, as (proceeding from a heart ignorant of the word of God) go after their owne good deuotion whiche is the honouring of them ſelues: and not after his good will reuealed in his word, which they are vtterly ignorant of. Where we may clearely ſee what account is to be made of Popiſhe prayers, where the woorde of God is not knowen of the moſte, and not regarded of the reſt: holding it for a ſure principle that ignorance is the mother of deuotion.</p>
            <p>To all ſuche prayers the Lorde doth anſwere, (according as it is written in the Prouerbes:<note place="margin">Prou. 1.28.</note>) <hi>They
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:7047:158"/>
ſhal call vpon me, but I will not anſwer: they ſhal ſeeke me early, but they ſhal not finde me: becauſe they hated know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and did not chooſe the feare of the Lord.</hi> A iuſt reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pence of reward, not to be heard when they in their diſtreſſe ſhal by prayer ſpeake vnto the Lord, becauſe they refuſed to heare the Lorde ſpeaking to them in his word.</p>
            <p>Here alſo are the prayers of all ſuche reproued (notwithſtanding they haue knowlege of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word, and followe not their good intents in praying vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lorde) as haue no affection, ioye, delite, nor good liking to ſee the lawe and the dueties there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of perfourmed in their life: nor yet any vexation or griefe in themſelues for tranſgreſſing the ſame. For prayer is a deſire of the minde, and therefore moſt deſirouſly affected after that which it ſeketh, whiche is the lawe and commaundement of the Lorde.</p>
            <p>Whereby it appeareth alſo how fruiteleſſe thoſe prayers are that come but from the lippes alone, the heart being altogether holden with other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and occupied wholy about other delightes. The thirde thing that is required to prayer, is, that it proceede from an emptie heart, whiche findeth want in it ſelfe of thoſe thinges that it beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth. For if a man feele no want of that which he aſketh, he can neuer be earneſt in aſking.</p>
            <p>The daunger heereof is then moſte to be feared, when we pray for thoſe thinges, the meanes wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we haue at home: as when a man prayeth for
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:7047:159"/>
ſucceſſe in a matter, hauing either ſuch wiſedome in him ſelfe, ſuch wealth, or ſuch friendes: that it is likely their nede to be no doubt made of the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe. It is hard in ſuch like cauſes to come to God with an emptie heart to begg it as earneſtly of him as if we wanted all ſuch helpes. And yet is all our prayers but a dallying with God, when wee ſhall nouriſh a ſecure opinion in our harts, that we haue that helpe within vs, for the which in wordes we are become ſutors vnto him in our prayers. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a wiſe man goeth aboute matters that vſually are compaſſed by wiſedome, or a rich-man about that that commonly we ſee compaſſed by riches, a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned man about that which is perfourmed by lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and the like is to be thought of all ſuch like matters: co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly there are either no prayers at all to God for the accompliſhing of ſuche matters, or if there be any, they are ſo colde and fainte: as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wraieth this ſecret opinion to be nouſeled within, that they ſhall not do greately amiſſe, though there come no helpe by their prayers. For ſurely, if the help at home were in truth doubted not to be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, the ſute for relief abroad would be earneſt.</p>
            <p>The importunate ſutor is hee that ſpeedeth of his ſute as we reade in Luke,<note place="margin">Luk. 11.8.</note> and he that is pinched with want wil ſpare no ſpeech for his relief: but he that feeleth no want, is to learne as yet how to beg. The prayers therefore of ſuch, as ſeldome or neuer examine themſelues by the lawe and commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes of God, are greatly to be feared: nay, are plainely to be charged with dallying in their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:7047:159"/>
with the Lord. For there is the ſight of all our pouertie plaine and euident, and all the ſight that we haue of it otherwiſe, is but a falſe light had in the ſhoppe of ſathan to vtter counterfet wares withal. The fourth thing required to praier, is, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we haue an aſſured hope of helpe from the Lorde: a ſure beliefe to obteine that which we doe aſke: for therefore is prayer an acceptable worſhip to God, becauſe it aſcribeth vnto him that honor of mercie to be helpful to our miſerie, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he is called vpon: neither tying his mercie to good deſeruing, nor yet his power to ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d cauſes, as if where they had no deſeruing, he had no mercy, or where they had no inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of helping, he had no hand or power to helpe. God is not truely honoured of the wicked, where either he is taken to be but a vaine name &amp; dead thing, in whom there is neither mercie nor power to be found in our neceſſitie (as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Epicures &amp; bellie-gods think, whatſoeuer they ſay,) or elſe ſuche weakeneſſe and imperfection in bothe, as cannot goe but by holdes and helpes from vs.</p>
            <p>Our ſinne then may not weaken our faith be it neuer ſo greate, when there is true repentaunce for it. For that ſhould darken the praiſe of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie: nor yet the want of all thoſe meanes that haue any likelihoode to helpe the matter, muſt driue vs to deſpaire: for that were to abridge and diminiſhe his power. The praier therfore that is ioyned with faith, cannot but be acceptable vnto him, giuing him the honour that is due vnto his name, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of that, being an acceptable ſeruice and ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice vnto the Lord. But prayer without faith, (de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpayring
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:7047:160"/>
to be heard) diſhonoureth the Lorde, and is returned without any comforte or hope of helpe,<note place="margin">Iames. 1.6</note> according as it is ſaide by the Apoſtle Iames, that he that doubteth and wauereth is like a waue of the ſea toſt of the winde &amp; carried away, which ſhall not receiue any thing of the Lord. Yet here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we are to be admoniſhed that we doe not take either that anguiſh and feare of the fleſhe in daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and trouble, or yet the weakeneſſe and feeble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of faithe, to be that wandering, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeaketh of. For feare and anguiſhe in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, weakeneſſe alſo in faith, are euer to be founde in fleſhe, and wil not be vtterly remoued, ſo long as we abide in this mortal life. That prayer that by faith holdeth out and continueth, (notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this feare of the fleſhe and feebleneſſe of faith) to ſollicite the Lorde, is ſure to ſpeede of her pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe at the laſt.<note place="margin">Rom. 5.1</note> For patience wil bring experience of his goodneſſe, and experience bringeth hope: for by continuing our prayers to the Lorde in the time of trouble, we are ſure to finde ſuche mitiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof, as not onely maketh it ſo tollerable that it may be borne: but alſo leadeth vs to a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hope, in that experience of mitigation alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die had: whiche thing is better learned with vſe, then it can be made plaine by any rule. Onely we haue to take heede, leſt we ſhould let goe the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of his goodneſſe towardes vs: either in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing taken away trouble at our requeſt, or elſe in hauing aſuaged the rage thereof, for experience ſtrongly vpholdeth hope, and mightily battereth

downe deſpaire. And nowe to incourage vs to prayer, we haue not onely a commaundement for it,<note place="margin">Pſal. 50.</note> (whiche maketh our obedience herein better then a ſacrifice offered vnto God, &amp; our contempt and neglecte of prayer, ſinne and rebellion againſt God) but alſo moſt plentiful and louing promiſes to allure vs with aſſured hope of rewarde, as it is written in Matthewe: <hi>Aske and it ſhalbe giuen you.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 7.7.</note> 
               <hi>Knocke and it ſhalbe opened. Seeke and ye ſhall finde.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What man is there among you whiche if his ſonne aſke him bread would giue him a ſtone? If ye then which are euil can giue to your children good giftes, howe muche more ſhall your Father whiche is in heauen giue good things to them that aſke him? Theſe promiſes whiche are grounded in the mercies of God, haue made the godlie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue hope to pray vnto him, and not their owne worthineſſe: nay they haue turned away their eyes from the feare of their owne ſinnes, after the hope of theſe promiſes made in mercie vnto his. A no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table example wherof we haue in Geneſis where Iacob after he confeſſed that he was not worthie the leaſt of thoſe benefites whiche he had alreadie receiued:<note place="margin">Gene. 32.10.</note> yet notwithſtanding is imboldened to pray for other benefites, becauſe God had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. The promiſes of God are founded in his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie: and therefore perfourmed, becauſe of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie. Theſe promiſes made al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> godly that euer were in any age bolde to pray. We therefore hauing the ſame promiſes, haue alſo the ſame hope and holde of his mercies that they had, and the ſame co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of our cauſe and ſuites whatſoeuer.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="304" facs="tcp:7047:161"/>For all their hope did hang and depend vppon the goodneſſe of God promiſed in his word, therefore let vs not be guiltie of ſo greate ſinne againſte our owne ſoules, as to be diſobedient by our neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of prayer to the lawe and commandement of our God: neither yet ſo iniurious vnto the Lord, as through infidelitie and miſtruſt to call into queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the veritie of his worde and trueth of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 1.</note> which are perfourmed vnto vs in our medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atour and redeemer Chriſt Ieſus, in whom all the promiſes are fulfilled.</p>
            <p>When the queſtion is then of our vnwoorthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, let vs call to minde that there was neuer any man vpon the earth, no Saint or ſeruaunt of God, howe holie or bleſſed ſo euer, that was heard for himſelfe: or had the promiſes perfourmed vnto him in reſpect of his owne worthineſſe, but onely in and for Chriſte, to whome the promiſes were made, who is the heire of all things, as it is written to the Hebrues:<note place="margin">Hebr. 1.2</note> and therefore no man hathe true title to any promiſe of bleſſednes, but in his name and for him, becauſe he is a part and member of Chriſt, who is Lord of all, &amp; hath true title there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto. Our hope ariſeth in the right of Chriſte, our clayme is good in his title, our comfort com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth by his intereſt. We beeing therefore mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers &amp; partes of him, haue lawfull title in his name who is the true and lawfull heire of all the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce, notwithſtanding that in any title that we can ſhewe for our ſelues, (as from our ſelues,) we remaine without hope of any help or comfort by
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:7047:161"/>
ſuite to recouer any thing at all: a deede of gifte being before made vnto the Lord Ieſus, of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance and all that belongeth therevnto. Euerie gifte and graunt that is made paſſeth in his name, and whatſoeuer ſuite is recouered apperteining to our happie eſtate it is entred likewiſe in the title &amp; right of him, and is giuen vnto vs becauſe we are members of him. The firſte Chapter of the Epiſtle to the Epheſians maketh plaine proofe hereof,<note place="margin">Ephe. 1.3.</note> that we haue no ſpirituall bleſſing but in Chriſte, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are his, and in him, whom the father hath appointed the lawful inheritour of all thinges. It is in plaine wordes affirmed by the Apoſtle to the Corinthes,<note place="margin">1.

            <p>Thoſe therefore that enter their ſuites and peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to God the Father in the title and right of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Saint, Angel, or Apoſtle whatſoeuer: whether they paſſe in their names alone, or in Chriſte his name and theirs together, they enter their ſuite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe, and therefore ſhall neuer profite by it. They take vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them to fruſtrate that graunt made from God the Father to Ieſus Chriſt alone, making an alienation thereof vnto others at their owne will and pleaſure, cancelling that deed of gifte and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging a newe, wherein the virgine Marie and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are made parteners with him, affirming that the ſuites and petitions muſt proceede in their

            </p>
            <p>If they woulde qualifie their ſpeeche, their owne practiſe will condemne them. For they haue prayed to bee accepted in the title, right, and deſeruing of the Sainctes, making media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours to him, who is for vs alreadie, and our a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone mediatour in deede, making him as a ſtraun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger or enimie rather, to be appeaſed by others: when as in verie deede hee is our beſt and deereſt friende, appointed our mediatour, and ſtanding on our part to appeaſe other.

            <p>The like affection was neuer founde in anie Saincte or Angel towardes vs. Shall wee then make him further off in affection, then the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and Saintes, and that they ſhoulde be ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner inclined to pitie towardes vs then hee, and therefore wee ſhoulde beginne with them in our prayers for the appeaſing of him?

This is not to make him the man that ſhould make them one who were at variance and debate, but to make him one of the two, that bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at variaunce, were to be made one. The word of God appointeth him the onely mediatour and peace-maker betweene the righteous God and the vnrighteous man: it is therefore the woorde of man, and no worde of GOD that maketh him the partie that is at variaunce with man, and muſt be reconciled by an other.

For it behoued him to goe about that worke alone, not beeing ioyned with others, nor hauing helpe or aide from any.

This is the thing that we ought to be reſolued fullie of, that it is the wil of our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Father by hearing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prayers of his to teſtifie good wil towards them, to giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> experience &amp; triall of it that way, to the ſtrengthening and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing of their faith. Being therefore readie to pray, let vs conſider a whyle of the promiſes made vnto them that aske,<note place="margin">Matth. 7.7.</note> 
               <hi>Knocke</hi> and <hi>Seeke,</hi> that we may be perſuaded by them to finde him Fatherly affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and inclining to our demaunds. For that doth this worde Father in the beginning of our prayers offer to our conſideration.</p>
            <p>His being in heauen, that is immediately ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of after this naming of our Father, doeth put vs in minde of an heauenly maieſtie and power in him, able to goe throughe with the purpoſe of his good will towardes vs, that in nothing our hope of being heard may be hindered. This helpe that is offered vnto our faith in prayer, doeth tell vs that the heart of man is hardly reſolued of this thing in trueth, that the Lord is ſo preſent alwayes by good will, power, and effect, at the ſuite of his ſeruauntes, that thereby they take true triall of his greate good will towardes them, matched with heauenly power, maieſtie, and glorie, for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourmance
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:7047:164"/>
thereof.</p>
            <p>And that there is great difference betweene this faithe, and thoſe opinions that commonly men are wont to conceiue of God. For the common pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the greater ſorte: notwithſtanding they be liberall of words and ſparing of no paines therein) yet are they farre from this perſuaſion required of neceſſitie vnto true and faithfull prayer.<note place="margin">Matth. 6.</note> They receiue hope and are confident by reaſon of the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boriouſneſſe of their paynes in the multitude of prayers, and other doinges of their owne deuiſing: they knowe not what the mercie of God meaneth, whiche onely worketh hope in his, and maketh them humble euen in the doinge of thoſe thinges that are commanded of him, becauſe it is the mere mercie and good will of God that hath wrought, them in thoſe that be his, and that doth accept them and take them in good part at their handes. The ende and marke that the ſeruauntes of God ſhould ſette before them in their prayers and petitions, is, to haue the Lorde glorified by perfourming that vnto his whiche he hathe promiſed, to haue his mercie and power to come vnto the eyes and eares of men, ſo euidently perfourming the trueth of his word, that they may ſee and be forced to confeſſe that he ruleth here in earth.</p>
            <p>Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we are readie to pray either for good thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to be giuen vs, or for euill things to be taken fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs, the care to haue God his mercies magnified, &amp; his goodneſſe promiſed towards his to be ſeene &amp; come to light thereby, to the credite, name, and

glorie of the Lord: ought principally to prouoke vs, and to be the chiefe thing that ſhould moue vs to make ſuite either for any good thing to bee gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vs, or to be eaſed of any affliction.</p>
            <p>And therefore are we taught in this his prayer, (which is a paterne vnto all our prayers) to begin them with the deſire that his name may bee hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, and his kingdome may come. In the whiche petitions, by the conſent of all the godlie learned, we ought to haue our mindes and ſenſes wholy ſhut vpp within the deſire that hee mighte haue a wonderfull name, and be ſeene and knowen to reigne as a king, in performing the trueth of his word here vpon earth. And notwithſtanding our good and benefite bee not diuided from this his glorie, but moſte neerely ioyned therevnto: yet muſt we flie ouer the care of that in our thoughts, and beginne our requeſtes in the earneſt deſire to ſee the tryall of his mercies and power promiſed vnto his experienced, and made knowen in trueth and in effect. Therefore you ſhall not looke for at my handes any ſeuerall declaration, what parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular things are conteined vnder the hallowing of his name, or the comming of his kingdome: for that were infinite, in aſmuch as there is no trueth promiſed in his worde perfourmed, but in that ſame his name is hallowed, and his kingdome commeth. And I tolde you euen now, that it was the deſire of his name, &amp; his glorie, that muſt ſend vs to prayer, and go before all our owne priuate commodities and reſpectes whatſoeuer.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="313" facs="tcp:7047:165"/>When wee doe pray that his will may bee doone in Earth as it is in Heauen, we are admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed in that petition, that the glorie of his name, and the power of his kingdome, are not fundered from his will and worde. It may not once enter into our thoughts, that the Lord will be glorified in ſhewing foorth the greatneſſe of his power and goodneſſe, any otherwiſe, then as hee hath declared in his word, whiche is the true witt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his will. Wherefore whenſoeuer wee are truely touched with the glorie of God his name, or the aduauncement of his kingdome, we are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to haue ſome thing perfourmed, whiche in his word he hath approued. In this petition, wee haue warrant to pray vnto the Lord for any thing that in his word he hath promiſed to beſtowe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon his, &amp; therfore are we taught to inquire at his mouth, I meane euen at his word what his wil and pleaſure is. For to preſume to aduaunce his glorie otherwiſe then he hath ſhewed vs in his worde, is to tempt the Lord: and to imagine to glorifie him, or to purchaſe praiſe vnto him, with that which by his word cannot be approued, is not to honour, but to diſhonor y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord, for he hath coupled the glorie of his name &amp; the honour of his kingdome to the doeing of his wil.

            <p>The Sainctes and ſeruantes of GOD are deſirous alwayes to haue his honoure aduaunced and his kingdome acknowledged by the ordering and gouerning of things here in earth according to his word, &amp; therfore after that Solomon had made an end of intreating the Lord to heare the prayer of his ſeruaunts in their ſeuerall neceſſities (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as they are recited in the booke of Kings) he rendereth a reaſon why hee would haue the Lord to graunt their petitions:<note place="margin">1.

            <p>Heere we ſee that blinde and ignoraunt pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers (what deuotion and good meaning ſo euer be pretended) are no prayers that euer the Lorde will accepte of, and that ſuche as doe not ſerue the Lord after his word, are cut off from all hope to haue their prayers heard to any benefite or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forte of theirs, becauſe the Lorde hath ioyned his mercie and power wherein hee will bee glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to the performaunce of his will, for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and good of thoſe that doe ſerue him after his worde.</p>

            <p>It is therfore moſte aſſured, that the Lord will be ſeene to bee the GOD of his, and to haue a kingdome heere vppon earth, by graunting them their requeſtes, when they ſhall call vppon him in their diſtreſſe: by leauing outwarde bleſſings as plaine confirmations of his inwarde heartie good will that he beareth towardes them.

But al men co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiue not this doctrin, they are his children alone, who in hart are aſſured that theſe which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly we cal caſual things, are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by him at the pleaſure of his will, &amp; grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted as pledges of his goodwill, to thoſe that in trueth call vpon him, and therfore in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> laſt verſe of that pſalme, it is ſaid: <hi>Who is wiſe that he may obſerue theſe things,</hi> becauſe they be onely his children that haue this wiſdome to obſerue this, to mark it, to knowe
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:7047:171"/>
that he diſpoſeth theſe outwarde things to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good of his, as pledges of his fatherly goodnes towards them: and therfore they onely call vpon him for them in faith, and in receiuing them doe aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in their heart reckon them as benefites receiued of him, confirming their faith therby, in the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of his eſpeciall goodwill towards them. By this that hath bene ſaid, it doth appeare, that when we are oppreſſed with anguiſh of heart, or vexed with any calamitie, either of bodie or minde: wee haue to ſeke our remedie at the hands of the Lord by prayer, in aſſured hope to receiue no ſmal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort thereby, if in faith and hope of his mercies we continue in calling vppon his name. It is a very hard matter, and the worke of faith alone, when a man is ſore diſtreſſed &amp; ſeeth no means to eſcape, then to call vpon God with faith and hope of bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heard: and if help ſhall come, it is as hard a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to aſcribe it vnto the mercies of God as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fruit of prayer, and an aſſured token of his goodwil ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering from the ground of our hart the praiſe that is due vnto him for it, and ſtrengthening our faith therby in the perſuaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his mercies towards vs. The ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of God glorifieth God in theſe things, acknowledging from his hearte, that God is the giuer and diſpoſer of them, but the vngodly what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer they ſay in worde, thinke in heart that they came by fortune and chaunce, and therefore doe not giue him the glorie for them, neither ſanctifie them by prayer as things receiued in eſpeciall good will from God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="325" facs="tcp:7047:171"/>In the Pſalme there is plentifully ſet foorth vnto vs,<note place="margin">Pſal. 91.</note> what protection the godly ſhall finde againſt all dangers in their diſtreſſes, &amp; in the end of that Pſalme, it is declared, by what meanes they ſhall eſcape thoſe dangers, in theſe wordes: <hi>He ſhall call vpon me and I will heare him, I will be with him in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, I will deliuer him and glorifie him, with long life will I ſatisfie him and ſhew him my ſaluation.</hi>

            <p>If any ſhall diligently reade that notable book of prayer, the prayer booke of the holy Ghoſte, I meane the booke of Pſalmes, he ſhall cleerely ſee that which before was ſaid, that the prophet is no way diſtreſſed, but hee runneth foorthwith vnto God by prayer, and findeth comfort at his hands, knowing (as he teſtifieth in the Pſalme) that <hi>the Lorde is neere vnto all that call vpon him,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>It hath bene declared, that we in this petition are taught to call vpon God for deliuerance, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer our neceſſitie ſhalbe, and that with hope in God to be heard, albeit we ſee no meanes how we ſhalbe holpen. It hath in like manner bene declared how hardly this is perfourmed of vs, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we ſhould haue hope when we can ſee no meanes lightly to helpe: ſo that it is the faithfull man alone that gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth this glorie vnto God. We learned out of the Pſalme y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the faithful man beeing toſſed with the tempeſt vpon the ſea, and ſeeing no poſſibilitie to eſcape, reſorteth vnto God by prayer, and findeth
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:7047:172"/>
the fruit thereof. This (as was ſaid before) is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie perfourmed in ſuch extremities, where there appeareth no meanes likely to deliuer vs. It is as hard a thing by reaſon of our corruption, to ſeeke at God his hands by true prayer, thoſe outwarde benefites that are procured by our laboure, as by meanes appointed of God to helpe vs therevnto. As for example, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a man hath an occupation to liue by, it is no eaſie matter for him to craue as har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily at God his hands for his liueing, as that man y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wanteth all ordinarie meanes to mainteine him. We are taught in this petition to beg at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hands of God by prayer, thoſe outwarde thinges that haue meanes ordeined to bring the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euen then when we haue the vſuall meanes. For the man y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hath friends of great credite, that are able to compaſſe matters of greater importance then he hath any to trouble them withall, muſt looke &amp; ſeke for ſucceſſe at the Lorde by prayer, as carefully as if he knew of no helpe or friendſhippe at all. When men of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, credite, or power, go aboute their matters without any calling vpon the name of God, they plainly denie the Lord that honour that is due vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him: for he muſt be acknowledged, as hee is in deed, the diſpoſer of all outwarde benefites, aſwell of thoſe that come by the meanes of our labour, indeuour, or other our meanes whatſoeuer, as thoſe that come ſo as we can giue no reaſon of the ſame, comming by caſualtie or fortune, as men commonly vſe to ſpeake.</p>
            <p>And in this petition wee are taught to craue
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:7047:172"/>
all outwarde benefites, and the ſucceſſe and goeing forewarde of all our laboures of the LORDE, who is the onely giuer of them, and without whoſe eſpeciall bleſſing all healpes and meanes are to no purpoſe: according as it is written in the Pſalme:<note place="margin">Pſa. 127.1.2</note> 
               <hi>Except the Lorde builde the houſe, they labour in vaine that builde it.</hi> It is vaine for you to ryſe early and lye downe late: decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring heereby, how little helpe there is in all our carefull toyle, to atteyne to wealth and earthlie commodities. And therefore in all our trauailes wee are taught to reſorte vnto GOD by earneſt and faithfull prayer. It is he that muſte bleſſe our going in, and our comming out,<note place="margin">Pal. 121.</note> as wee do reade in the Pſalmes. Wherfore the godlie looke for a peculiar bleſſing of GOD vppon their laboures, and ſeeke vnto him for it, when as the vngodly aſcribe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> honour that is due vnto God, vnto thoſe helps and meanes of counſel, labour, or indeuour, which are but the inſtrumentes appointed of the Lord therevnto. The daunget of this diſeaſe is ſo greate, and man ſo eaſilie drawen to ſeeke vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the healpes that hee hath without any due reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect and regarde of the Lorde: that in expreſſe wordes he giueth his people warning of this of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence in Deuteronomie.<note place="margin">Deu. 8.17.</note> 
               <hi>Beware leaſte thou ſay in thine hearte, my power and the ſtrength of myne owne hand hath prepared me this aboundaunce: but remember the Lord thy GOD:</hi> For it is he whiche giueth the power to get ſubſtaunce,</p>
            <p>Let vs learne to ſanctifie all outwarde bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:7047:173"/>
by prayer, ſeeking them vnfeignedly at the Lorde, and acknowledging them in trueth, and from a perſuaded heart, to haue beene giuen vs from the hands of our God, what ſoeuer hath bene ſtore or ſtrength of our meanes to procure the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by. For otherwiſe they are not pure vnto vs, if we bee not reſolued of the giuer thereof, reaching through all meanes into the ſight of his goodneſſe, who is the Lord and diſpoſer of theſe temporall thinges.</p>
            <p>A Chriſtian is taught in this petition not to be tormented before hand, with the feare of an hard eſtate and euil condition in time to come, becauſe the Lord (who is the diſpoſer of all outward thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges) hath taught his to reſort vnto him for the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie of the day, in the day and time of their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſe: promiſing to ſtand by them in their troubles and wants, and to declare himſelfe to be their God by the benefites and mercies, that he will graunt at their requeſts. What a great burthen therfore are we diſcharged of by the Lord, who in promiſing to heare vs in the day of our calamitie, hath cut off many cares, griefes, and vexations which long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they come, torment the vngodly, and when they are vppon them, doe driue them either to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire or to vngodly ſhiftes.</p>
            <p>How iuſt alſo is the plague and puniſhment of thoſe, who refuſing this benefite of the Lorde, will haue their owne care and feare vſurpe vpon the mercie and goodneſſe of GOD: who in ſingular good will hathe returned vnto vs the benefite of our thoughtes and cares, to haue them
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:7047:173"/>
otherwiſe beſtowed for our good in his ſeruice, willing vs not to be careful before hand for the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie to come, for the care of the day ſhall ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for the ſame.<note place="margin">Matth. 6.34.</note> If the Lorde in mercie abate and giue backe this benefite of our care, that we may haue it before the neceſſitie come free to beſtowe vpon his ſeruice for our owne profite: what mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is there in our refuſall? nay, what wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and contempt of the grace of God? That man therfore that learneth not to abate the care for out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward daungers and neceſſities to come, can neuer in trueth pray vnto the Lord that he would giue him this day his daily breade. For theſe wordes of daily bread, and this day, doe cutt off the care and torment of times farre off. By the promiſe whiche in this petition we doe truſt and depende vppon,<note place="margin">Hebr. 13.5</note> the holie Ghoſt to the Hebrues cureth co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetouſneſſe: willing them to be content with that they haue, &amp; to ſee y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their conuerſation be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out couetouſneſſe, becauſe the Lorde hath ſaide, I will not leaue thee nor forſake thee.</p>
            <p>This promiſe of the Lord, that he will not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake his in the day of their neceſſitie, is ſet as a bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worke to beate backe their feare of want, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full coueting that ariſeth therevpon: that they may hold them wel content and apaide with their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtate and condition. The holie Ghoſte ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a great diuerſitie betwene the godlie and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked touching theſe earthly thinges: for they come to the godlie as it were ſleeping: for ſo doeth he tearme their quiet laboure, that wayte aſſuredly
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:7047:174"/>
for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſucceſſe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Lord, in reſpect of the careful toile y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the vngodly are tormented with, as if their liuing lay onely in their trauels. There is a ſecrete bleſſing of the Lorde which muſt be ſought for at his handes by faithfull prayes, without the which all care and trauel that can be taken wil not auaile. <hi>It is the bleſsing of the Lord that maketh riche</hi> (ſayeth the holie Ghoſt.<note place="margin">Prou. 10.22</note>) There is more in that then our fleſhly and miſtruſtfull heart can eaſily be perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of. Let vs therefore learne to leſſen our miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſtfull care, that we may teſtifie to the worlde y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> increaſe of our faith, in the perſuaſion of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie towardes vs, according as this petition doeth admoniſhe vs. For in praying vnto him for theſe outward commodities, we doe acknowledge that they be at his diſpoſing, and that all the labour in the worlde will not fetche them, vnleſſe it pleaſe him to giue ſucceſſe. Wherefore we may plainely ſee, that when we haue trauelled or vſed thoſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward meanes wherby commonly benefits are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, we haue but accompliſhed one part, and the leaſt part of that that bringeth the benefite in deed. Prayer muſt alſo be vſed, and the Lorde he is to be intreated, and this is not the leaſt but the chiefe parte.</p>
            <p>The godly tempt not the Lord by refuſing his meanes, but euen then when they doe vſe thoſe meanes, they are muche in prayer for the ſucceſſe and going forward of them: whether it be labour, counſell, or friendſhippe that they they vſe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe their matter by. For the want of this, we ſee
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:7047:174"/>
it fall out in common experience, that the wiſeſt men haue had ſuche ſucceſſe with their deuiſes, as the moſt fooliſh man that is, could not haue made a madder matche, then often times falleth out euen there where their care and counſell hath beene the greateſt: whiche teacheth vs to giue the Lorde his due, to acknowlege him the Lord and gouernour of thoſe temporall commodities, to begge them at his handes by true and vnfeigned prayer, and by faith to depend vpon him, and not vpon our trauel, no not where it is the greateſt and promiſeth the moſte vnto vs.</p>
            <p>Worldly men that depend wholy in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion of their heart vpon the help of their hands, their wiſdome, or their wealth or friendſhip: do diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble with the Lorde in this requeſt. For they ſeeke that at him as his gift, whiche their heart tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth them that they haue alreadie at home. Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous men that wold gather faſter then he will giue, how can they in trueth ſeeke it at his hands: when they are not at any time content with y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> meaſure or portion that he doth giue, neither reſt in his diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution, hauing ſuch a hungrie deſire as would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the Lord, and not be limited or preſcribed by the Lord? The oppreſſer, hard &amp; cruel dealer, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> pretendeth to beg his bread &amp; temporal co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modity of the Lord, &amp; in the meane time is the purueyer, and prouider for him ſelfe, by ſuche oppreſſing and vnmercifull meanes as the Lorde abhorreth, doeth dallie with the Lorde, deceiue him ſelfe, and maketh his praier a curſe vnto his owne ſoule, and
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:7047:175"/>
a witneſſe in the day of iudgment againſt his own conſcience: in that he hath profeſſed in this prayer that to be the Lords gift, whiche he ſought of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than by ſuche wayes and meanes as he approueth, but the Lord abhorreth them. We pray here for others aſwell as for our ſelues, he therfore that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth to pray for others their good eſtate concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning temporall thinges, and yet conueyeth that whiche is others, or withholdeth it eyther by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence or deceipte: with what conſcience doeth he offer this petition to the Lord? The children of God haue their faith declaring it ſelfe by outward thinges, while they doe depende vppon him for them: wherein the vngodly bewray their wante, howſoeuer they boaſt of their inward perſuaſion of his goodneſſe. For if the Lord ſpeede them not to their contentation, they will not ſticke to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide for themſelues, by ſuche either open or ſecrete oppreſſion as he hathe plainely forbidden, as if he were onely the God of the ſoule, and not of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die alſo, &amp; whole man, to prouide for both, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the good pleaſure of his will: and wee by faith to depende and wayte for a ſpeciall bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from him, euen in outward thinges which the vngodly cannot ſee into. For they binde the Lord ſo vnto the inſtrumentes whereby hee wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth his will, that in truth they haue the glorie, and he is altogether depriued thereof.</p>
            <p>They be only his children that in truth acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him the giuer of theſe outwarde benefites, &amp; therfore wil vſe no meanes beſides thoſe which
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:7047:175"/>
he hathe approued. The other in ſeeking helpe by meanes forbidden of him, doe plainely ſpeake in thoſe their doings y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they haue no faith nor co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in him: we may in faith &amp; good hope aſke thoſe thinges, becauſe they make for the glorie of God, who doth reigne and rule in earth by giuing vnto his their wantes, euen in theſe outward and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral things, according as we may learne in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pſalm.<note place="margin">Pſalm. 146.</note> Where after many words declaring that God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuteth iuſtice for the oppreſſed, giueth bread to the hungrie, loſeth the priſoners, kepeth the ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, relieueth the fatherleſſe, ouerthroweth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> way of the wicked: immediately it followeth, <hi>The Lord ſhal reigne for euer, ô Sion.</hi> As if the Lord ſhould not be known to reigne, if he ſhould fayle his ſeruants calling and depending vpon him in their diſtreſſes. For we may not think that he faileth his ſeruants, when he giueth them better benefites, then thoſe which they doe aſke. As if they craue deliuerance out of preſent daunger, and he by taking them in mercie out of this life, worketh a final riddaunce out of all daunger: ſhall we ſay that the Lord hath not heard them? Likewiſe if their neceſſitie what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer, indureth longer then they wiſhe, or increaſe vpon them after their ſuite made for deliueraunce, becauſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord wil worke a more glorious worke in their deliuerance for the comfort and increaſe of their faithe, notwithſtanding it be ſome long time after: ſhall we ſay the Lorde hathe reiected their prayers, becauſe he hath delayed ſo long? God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidde. For the Lorde according to the good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:7047:176"/>
of his will, hath not iuſtified the innocencie and good cauſes of his ſometimes, no not before their death. And as it hath bene ſaid of the time, ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe is it to be thought of the meanes &amp; maner of helping &amp; relieuing vs, if y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hath ben other then we coulde haue preſcribed, ſhall we denie the Lord to haue hearde our ſuites, becauſe the helpe that we haue had, hath not beene in the ſame manner that we haue conceiued to be beſt? This one thing we haue often to call to remembrance, that before the requeſt of theſe outward neceſſities, there is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of doing his will here in earth: to teach vs that the Lord is thus helpful, in outward neceſſities op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing them, vnto the prayers of ſuche, as haue not onely the knowledge of his will, but alſo the deſire to do it.</p>
            <p>For that goeth before the other in our prayer, &amp; therfore in our deſire, in as much as true praier go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not without y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deſire of the hart vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> requeſt of the tongue. Thoſe therfore, that looke for theſe outward bleſſinges when they call vnto the Lord, muſt learne both to know what his will is reueled in his word, &amp; alſo to haue a deſire to doe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame. For vnto thoſe that thus worſhip him, the Lord hath promiſed to incline his eare, according as it is written in theſe wordes: <hi>We knowe that God heareth not ſinners,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iohn. 6.31.</note>

<pb n="335" facs="tcp:7047:176"/>
which is opened to vs in his word. To the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of this may be added that, which is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the firſt Epiſtle of S. Iohn in theſe wordes, <hi>whatſoeuer we aske we receiue of him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iohn. 3.22.</note> 
               <hi>becauſe we do thoſe thinges whiche are pleaſing in his ſight.</hi> By this it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth that witches &amp; ſorcerers (whiche wil haue the name of wiſemen and wiſe women) who are thought to do ſo many things with prayer, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not preuaile with the Lorde to obteine theſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward thinges of him in fauour and goodwil: for of all people they are the moſt ignorant of his will, &amp; therefore of his worſhip. But as euen nowe it was proued, if any man be a worſhipper of God and a doer of his will, him heareth he. Thoſe are they to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Lord hath made promiſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he wilbe mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifully inclined vnto in their prayers &amp; petitions, he is nighe vnto al that call vpon him in trueth, he wil fulfil the deſire of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> feare him, he wil heare their crie and will ſaue them.<note place="margin">Pſal. 145.19.20.</note> 
               <hi>The Lord preſerueth all them that loue him,</hi> (ſaith the holy Ghoſt.) It may ſo fal out that the prayers of witches &amp; ſuch like may be inſtrumentes of his iuſtice, for the puniſhment of ſinne in others: and for the hardening of their own harts: but it is as ſure as the lord liueth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they neuer obteine any thing by their prayers to their good, in fauour &amp; good liking of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lord.

<pb n="336" facs="tcp:7047:177"/>
for to ſuccour and help them, as the matter ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire. Wherefore they require it as a part of his owne glorie, as an argument and aſſurance that he reigneth here in earth, as a matter that is agreeable to his good pleaſure and will, according as they haue learned out of his word, whiche giueth them an aſſured hope of beeing heard, and maketh them bolde to call vppon him, knowing that his owne glorie, the renoune of his owne kingdome, and a matter that is agreeable to his owne good liking and will, is in hande, while their diſtreſſes &amp; wants are brought before the Lord, to be holpen, &amp; relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by him. A manifeſt confirmation &amp; proofe of this is to be found in the Pſalme: In the whiche place the prophet ſpeaketh much in the beginning of extolling the name of God,<note place="margin">Pſal. 145.</note> of meditating the beautie of his glorious maieſtie, of ſhewing foorth the glorie of his kingdome, and ſpeaking of his power: after this it followeth, that the Lorde vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth all that fall, that he fulfilleth the deſire of them that feare him, that he wil heare their crie, and will ſaue them: as if the glorie of his name, and renoune of his kingdome were ſeene in this: to lift vp his that fall, to heare their crie and ſaue them. And no doubt the Lord will haue it know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en here vpon earth, that he is Lorde ouer all true &amp; faithfull in his word, by the helpe and defence that he will graunt vnto his, whenſoeuer in their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſe they ſhal by faithful prayer reſorte vnto him. His meaning is to leaue manifeſt and plaine profe that he ruleth herein earth, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by that mercie that
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:7047:177"/>
he hath to beſtowe vpon his, who cal and crie vnto him in their neceſſitie with an aſſured hope of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heard. For the glorie of his name, the honour of his kingdome, and the good pleaſure of his will go ioyntly together with the hearing &amp; regarding of their cauſe: according as they are ſet before this petition, in this fourme of prayer that is preſcribed by the Lord. Where, before we make mention of daily bread, there is requeſt made for the halow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his name, the comming of his kingdome, and dooing his wil, becauſe euen then when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieueth the neceſſities of his that call vpon him, his name is hallowed, his kingdome commeth, and that is perfourmed which is agreeable to his will. This cannot but miniſter hope and comfort vnto vs in all our neceſſities, that his honour and glorie is after a manner darkened in our diſtreſſe, and as it were ſuffereth in the ſame, which the lord God cannot but erecte and aduaunce, and therefore fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour our diſtreſſe, wherevnto his owne honour is ſo neerely ioyned. Nowe let vs pray, &amp;c.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N this petition we do require the forgiueneſſe of our ſinnes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in wee are to vnderſtande that by this worde ſinne, is not onely ment the guiltines that we haue brought in vpon vs by offending, but alſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> puniſhment whatſoeuer that followeth therevpon, as ſhal hereafter (God willing) moſte plainely appeare. We are therefore put in hope by this petition, to haue as well the puniſhment as the fault of our ſinne pardoned, &amp; forgiuen vs, ſo that when any puniſhment of God is vppon his, they neede not to deſpaire: for we are taught and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by him to make ſuite for the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, which could not be done in faith, if the Lord had not promiſed vnto vs the pardon &amp; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giueneſſe thereof. The godlie at all times when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny affliction was vppon them, haue reſorted to the Lord for the forgiuenes of their ſinnes. And why? Are we not taught ſo to do in the holy ſcripture?<note place="margin">1. Kinges. 8.</note> Doth not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> praier of Solomon leaue this for a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall doctrine vnto the Church: that when any puniſhment is vpon thoſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> be his, they ſhould co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe their ſinnes in trueth, with an aſſured hope in ſo doing to finde fauour at his handes: and eaſe of their griefe when they ſhal truely turne vnto him? according as it is written in that Chapter in theſe words:<note place="margin">Verſe. 33.</note> When thy people Iſrael ſhalbe ouerthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en before the enimie, becauſe they haue ſinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee, and turne againe to thee, and confeſſe thy name, &amp; pray &amp; make ſupplication vnto thee,
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:7047:178"/>
then heare thou in heauen, and be mercifull vnto the ſinne of thy people Iſrael, &amp; bring them againe vnto the land which thou gaueſt vnto their fathers. A plaine proofe we haue in this place that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God may reſort boldly vnto God, euen then when his puniſhment is vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for the forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their ſinnes: and as plaine is this alſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his mercie toward them, &amp; pardoning of their ſinnes, conſiſteth not only in the remouing of the fault fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them, but alſo of the puniſhment that is due for the fault &amp; tranſgreſſion. For he praieth that when the people ſhalbe led out of their land by their enimies, becauſe they haue ſinned againſt the Lord, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> if they ſhall confeſſe their ſinnes and turne vnto the Lord: then he would be merciful and bring them againe vnto the land, which is to remoue the puniſhment from them, as well as the fault and guiltineſſe. This was that puniſhment to bee captiues and priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in their enimies land: when they are brought home this puniſhment is remoued. The like profe we haue of this matter in the ſame Chapter, in theſe wordes: <hi>When heauen ſhalbe ſhut vppe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verſe. 35.</note> 
               <hi>&amp; there ſhalbe no rayne, becauſe they haue ſinned againſte thee: and ſhall pray in this place, and turne from their ſinne, when thou doeſt afflicte them, then heare thou in heauen, &amp; pardon the ſinne of thy ſeruants, &amp; giue rayne vpon the land.</hi> They that haue ſinned are incouraged to pray vnto the Lord, &amp; are aſſured to be heard, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſhall in trueth bewayle and confeſſe their ſinne.</p>
            <p>Marke it alſo, that as well in this place, as in that former, the pardon of their ſinne remoueth the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment,
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:7047:179"/>
and reacheth vnto that as well as vnto the guilt therof. I do note this becauſe of that doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the church of Rome, which doth affirme that God doth pardon the fault of his, and yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine ſtill the puniſhment, which they ſay muſt bee redeemed by their ſatiſfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. A daungerous doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine that God ſhuld abſolue them of the fault, &amp; yet preſſe them with the puniſhment whiche doth not apperteine vnto them, but in reſpecte of their offence, becauſe they are faultie: this doctrine char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the Lord with iniurie. For if he ſhal remit &amp; forgiue the fault &amp; yet reſerue the puniſhment, he puniſheth without a cauſe. For where the fault is pardoned, the man is as if he had not offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, he is no longer accounted a treſpaſſer. Can it then ſtand with the iuſtice of the Lord, to puniſh him whom he him ſelfe hath iuſtified as no offender, in the free pardoning and forgiuing of his fault? We do ſee it throughout this chapter, that when they ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe their fault and turne vnto the Lorde, they are diſcharged of the puniſhmente, and that the holie Ghoſt is ignorant of this diuorcement betweene y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> puniſhment &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fault, which the church of Rome hath inuented to vtter their mercha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dize of ſatiſfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions withall. And leſt any ſhould thinke that this prayer for the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, did but take place in theſe ſpecial cauſes in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> remouing of thoſe particular &amp; ſpeciall puniſhments, the holie Ghoſt maketh it generall in the ſeuen and thirtie verſe.</p>

Moreouer, leaſt it ſhould be excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againſt this, that in deede Solomon praied that puniſhments might be remoued when they ſhould confeſſe and truely bewaile their ſinne: but howe can it be proued that the Lorde did euer promiſe to heare any ſuche prayers.<note place="margin">2.

               <note place="margin">Pſal. 107.10</note> In the Pſalme there is plentifull profe, that the Lorde wilbe intreated to forgiue the ſinnes of his ſeruauntes, and to remitte their puniſhmentes when they ſhall in true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce, humble them ſelues before him. <hi>They</hi>

               <hi>and brake their bandes in ſunder.</hi> In that Pſalme there is likewiſe proofe of the ſame matter apparant enoughe in theſe wordes. <hi>Fooles by reaſon of their tranſgreſſion, and becauſe of their iniquitie are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, their ſoule abhorreth all meate, &amp; they are brought to deaths doore, then they crie vnto the Lord in their trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and he deliuereth them in their diſtreſſe: he ſendeth his word and healeth them, &amp; deliuereth them from their graues.</hi> It were an infinite worke to recite thoſe places in the booke of Pſalmes that proue the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of God to remoue puniſhmentes from the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders, when they ſhall in true repentaunce turne vnto him. It is a harde matter in great affliction to perſuade the man that is ſore afflicted for his ſinne, that there is mercy with the lord to remoue his pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, if he ſhal truly humble him ſelfe in repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for his ſinne: yet, we ſee what plaine proofes there are of the ſame, to increaſe our faith in the perſuaſion to haue our ſinnes forgiuen, when we are truely grieued and penitent for the ſame.</p>
            <p>This is a doctrine moſt needefull to be ſtoode vpon, becauſe the bleſſing that the Lord hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to beſtowe vpon his, by reaſon of our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption are rather deliueraunces from euill, then preſeruations in any continuall courſe of proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:7047:180"/>
I ſay they rather come in after our afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then ſtande continually with vs to keepe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction from vs, whiche many miſtaking, haue ſtumbled at the afflicted eſtate of the children of God: but the worde of the Lord doth guide thoſe that be his, to looke to the end of the vpright man. Marke the vpright man, and beholde the iuſt, for the end of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> man is peace (ſaith the Prophet.) And almoſte all thoſe requeſtes that Solomon maketh for the people of God,<note place="margin">Pſal. 37.37.</note> are to haue bleſſinges &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites procured vnto them after their troubles &amp; afflicted eſtate. We ſee therefore howe neede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full it is to holde this doctrine of forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, that we ſtumble not at the croſſe of Chriſt, that we do not murmur or deſpaire in our afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: that we ſhould not ſhake off hope, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding our grief whatſoeuer haue had long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance and abode with vs: that we nouriſhe no wrong iudgement of the eſtate of the Church and children of God, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we decide not with the vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt the ſeruants &amp; ſaints of God.

we remoue them by deſerte: but is added for our inſtruction, and for our comfort. For our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, to teache vs that the Lord requireth this at our handes, that we ſhould be mercifull becauſe he is mercifull. For our comforte to tell vs that if we whiche be men can remitte the wronges and iniuries done againſt vs, much more will our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Father, who is without compariſon aboue man in mercie and compaſſion, forgiue the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces &amp; ſinnes of his ſeruants, when they ſhal in true repentaunce ſeeke vnto him. For the ſame it is needefull for our infirmitie to receiue perſuaſion of his mercie, eſpecially when his iudgement ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be vppon vs, and puniſhment which is the aſſured ſigne of his diſpleaſure ſhall preſſe vs, it is then a harde matter to conceiue hope that the Lorde will forgiue vs. For infidelitie is as deepely rooted in our heartes as any ſinne or iniquitie whatſoeuer, therefore the Lord hath left vs (who are taught by his ſpirite to forgiue vnto others their offences co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted againſt vs) an aſſured hope to finde fauour at his handes: who will neuer be found inferiour vnto man in mercie. Therfore is it thus writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in Luke,<note place="margin">Luke. 11.4.</note> 
               <hi>Forgiue vnto vs our ſinnes,</hi> for euen we forgiue euerie man that is indebted to vs. And as it is neceſſarie that we ſhould bee vpholden with this hope, ſo is it requiſite that we remember that which is written in Matthew,<note place="margin">Matt. 6.15.</note> 
               <hi>If ye doe not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue men their treſpaſſes, no more will your father forgiue you your trespaſſes:</hi> to admoniſh vs that the Lorde will haue his to reſemble him, and heare this his
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:7047:181"/>
image of mercie before the world. If we be taught to remitt and forgiue offences vnto others, when they ſhall haue done vs any wrong, we may eaſily perceiue that the Lord will not haue vs to cheriſh our ſelues in the hope of beeing heard, when wee ſhall offer vnto other iniurie and wrong. For if a Chriſtian be admoniſhed in this petition, ſo far to profite that hee learne to forgiue iniuries done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him: much more would the Lorde haue him to be farre from offending others by iniuries done vnto them.</p>
            <p>The laſt petition wherin we craue that the Lord would not leade vs into temptation, but deliuer vs from euill, doeth admoniſh vs that the almightie vſeth to puniſh ſinne with ſinne, that when men ſhall haue long continued in ſinne, they ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſo blinde and hardened therein by the iuſte iudgemente of GOD, that hardly ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time after muche affliction, they can bee cured of the ſame. That the godly are ſubiecte vnto a kinde of hardneſſe of heart, which is a puniſhment for their former ſinnes, laide vpon them from the Lord, as may appeare by that prayer of the church of God, whereof wee reade in the Prophet Iſaie, in theſe wordes:<note place="margin">Eſay. 63.17.</note> 
               <hi>O Lorde why haſte thou made vs to erre from thy wayes, and hardened our heartes from thy feare, returne for thy ſeruaunts ſake, and for the tribes of thine inheritaunce.</hi> It is not that hardneſſe of heart, whiche is peculiar to the reprobate, that is menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in this place, but to bee ſo taken with the ſnares of ſinne, and ſo ledd into temptation and
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:7047:182"/>
blinded &amp; intangled therein, as the godlyeſt that lyueth may bee, and yet afterwarde by afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or ſome other meanes, deliuered from the ſame.</p>
            <p>For when it pleaſeth the Lorde to lay afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vpon his, no doubt there is in them this erring from his wayes, and hardneſſe of hearte from his feare, which the Churche of GOD com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth of in this place, and whiche the Lorde purpoſeth to cure. For he is not cruel to puniſh when there is no cauſe, but his meaning is to mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie their harde heartes thereby, that they may be humbled vnder the gouernement of his holie worde.</p>
            <p>We pray therfore in this petition, that we may not bee hardened through the deceiptfulneſſe of ſinne, for the auoyding wherof, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> children of God are admoniſhed in the Epiſtle to the Hebrues to exhorte one another.<note place="margin">Heb. 3.13.</note> 
               <hi>Exhorte one another</hi> (ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the holie Ghoſte) <hi>while it is called to day, leaſt any of you bee hardened through the deceiptfulneſſe of ſinne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This petition of not leading vs into temptation, but deliuering vs from euil, doth wel followe that of forgiueneſſe of ſinnes. For when it pleaſeth the Lord to forgiue ſin, he deliuereth them from bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hardened therein: giuing them the ſight of the deceipt that is in it, and alſo power and maiſterie ouer the rage thereof. In that prayer of Solomon, whiche we haue ſo often heard of before, when he
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:7047:182"/>
prayeth that the people of God may haue their puniſhmentes remoued, when they call vppon him: there is alwayes added the condition of tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from their ſinne, either in expreſſe wordes, or elſe in wordes that neceſſarily importe the ſame. As to take one example for many, in that Chapiter hee hath theſe wordes: <hi>When Heauen ſhall be ſhutt vpp, and there ſhall be no rayne,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Reg. 8.35.</note> 
               <hi>becauſe they haue ſinned againſt thee, and they ſhall pray in this place, &amp; confeſſe thy name, and turne from their ſinn, when thou doeſt afflict them, then heare thou in Heauen, and pardon the ſinne of thy ſeruauntes, and of thy people Iſrael, when thou haſte taught them the good way wherein they may walke:</hi> ſo that the turning from ſinne is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily required of them that doe looke for the forgiueneſſe of ſinne. And then eſpecially when the Lorde ſhall teſtifie againſt vs from Heauen, by puniſhments laide vppon vs: wee haue to call to minde our former ſinnes, and ceaſſe to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe and ſecure therein. For when the Lord for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giueth ſinne, hee alſo cureth ſinne, not ſuffering vs any longer to ſleepe in the ſame, beeing ſnared with the baytes and allurementes thereof, but begetteth in vs a new care to ſhake it off, and a new watchfulneſſe ouer it.</p>
            <p>There is added to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end of this petition, <hi>For thine is the kingdome, the power, &amp; the glorie for euer:</hi> which do<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>eth admoniſh vs of ſundrie profitable inſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, for by it we are taught what ſhuld be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end of our petitions, why we would haue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> graunted, euen
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:7047:183"/>
that his kingdome, power, &amp; glorie, may be adua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. For (as we haue learned before) while that the Lord frameth his to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> obedience of his wil, giueth good things vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, remoueth euil thinges from them, his name is halowed, his kingdome co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth &amp; his wil is done here in earth: for by dealing thus with his ſeruaunts, he will be knowen to rule and reigne here vpon earth, &amp; be glorified in the ſame. This deſire therefore to haue him glorified, ſhould bee bothe at the beginning and end of our prayers, whether our ſuit be for ſpirituall graces, or for te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall bleſſings. By this alſo our faith is ſtrengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the hope to obteine our petitions, becauſe the Lorde cannot neglect the glorie of his name, and the honour of his kingdome, whiche depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vpon the perfourmaunce of his mercies to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes his ſeruauntes that call vpon him: &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our hope cannot deceiue vs, beeing ioyned ſo neere vnto the glorie of our God.</p>
            <p>Moreouer in this we are admoniſhed, that it is not the worthyneſſe of our ſelues, nor yet of any other, but the honour of his name, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> commendeth our ſuites and petitions vnto the Lord. Finally, heerein we are admoniſhed of a ſpeciall worſhippe and ſeruice, which is thanks giuing vnto GOD, when ſoeuer wee receiue any benefite, of what kinde ſoeuer. For we acknowledging in our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, not onely that hee hath the diſpoſing of theſe benefites, but alſo that his kingdome, glorie, &amp; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour conſiſteth in the rewarding of his with the ſame: ſhall be found traytors to the crowne of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:7047:183"/>
if after benefites receiued, wee doe not by thanks giuing, confeſſe and acknoweledge the ſame. This giuing of thanks is a ſpeciall worſhipp and ſeruice of God, in ſomuch that the Lorde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecting ſacrifice, placeth his honour in thanksgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing. <hi>Will I eate the fleaſh of Bulles,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 50.13.</note> 
               <hi>or drinke the bloude of Goates?</hi> (ſayth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord by his Ptophet.) <hi>Offer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God praiſe, and pay the vowes vnto the moſte high, and call vppon mee in the day of thy trouble, ſo will I deliuer thee, and thou ſhalt glorifie me.</hi> And in the laſte verſe of that pſalme, it is ſaid that he who offereth praiſe vnto the Lord, doth glorifie him. Whereby it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth that the Lord eſteemeth thanksgiuing as a ſpeciall worſhip and ſeruice of him, whiche may well bee perceiued in ſundrie places of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but eſpecially in the booke of the Pſalmes. It is in deede a ſeruice of God, peculiar and proper vnto the children of God. For the wicked are not acquainted with it, they ſee not the Lord his arme in their deliuerances, they ſee not through the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments that God vſeth to helpe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by, into the eſpeciall goodwill and fauour of GOD: from whence the godly take thoſe healpes to come as a plaine profe therof. Therfore doth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prophet ſay, <hi>The voice of ioy and deliuerance ſhalbe in the tabernacles of the righteous,</hi> ſaying,<note place="margin">Pal. 118.15.</note> the right hand of the Lorde hath done valiauntly. Hee maketh it the peculiar worke of the righteous, to reioyce in the Lorde, and in heart to prayſe him. For, notwithſtanding all people taſte liberally of his benefits, yet the fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of his fatherly goodneſſe whiche procureth
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:7047:184"/>
giuing of thanks in deed, is proper onely vnto the children of God.</p>
            <p>It is a ſingular priuiledge, that he doth vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe his elect alone, when he giueth ſuch a ſweete taſte vnto his benefites, as driueth their heartes to reioycing and giuing of thankes: not onely in the comfort of the preſent benefite, but alſo in that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing receiued an aſſured token of his fauour, they peaceably paſſe ouer the courſe of their life, aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them ſelues that they are had in eſpeciall rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning and account with the Lord. Therefore the Prophete is bolde to haue this ſpeech of them.<note place="margin">Pſal. 89.15.16.</note> 
               <hi>Bleſſed is the people that reioyce in thee, they ſhall walke in the light of thy countenaunce. O Lorde, they ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce continually in thy name, and in thy righteouſneſſe ſhal they exalt them ſelues.</hi> He maketh it no common matter to reioyce in the Lord, but matter belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing onely to the electe and bleſſed people of God, how greatly it pleaſeth the Lorde. The Apoſtle wittneſſeth in the Epiſtle to the Corinthes,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 1.11.</note> where hee requireth the prayer of the church of God for him in his affliction, that when his deliueraunce is obteyned by the prayers of many: many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons may giue thanks vnto God. Which notably declareth how acceptable a ſeruice it is, to giue thanks vnto God, when the afflictions of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God ſerue therevnto, and are beecome a ſpeciall ende of the ſame. As wittneſſeth in like manner the Prophet:<note place="margin">Pſal. 102.19</note> 
               <hi>The Lorde hath looked downe from the height of his Sanctuarie, that hee might heare the mourning of the priſoner, and deliuer the children of
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:7047:184"/>
death, that they may declare the name of the Lorde in Hieruſalem and his praiſe in Sion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if it be demaunded why the ſacrifice of thanks giuing is ſo acceptable a worſhip and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of the Lord? The anſwere is ready, becauſe it aſcribeth the gouernment and diſtribution of all benefites vnto the Lord: denying them to come by caſualtie or chaunce, as doe the vngodly what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer they ſay, in that they are neither comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted truely in them, nor yet thankfull for them. Moreouer it acknowledgeth God not to be a dead thing and bare name, that regardeth not men that ſerue him in the obedience of his will, but that in trueth hee hath a care of his Church, helpeth in their neede, and regardeth them in perfourming the trueth of his promiſe towardes them. This acknowledging of the mercies of God by giueing of thanks, helpeth forwarde the faith of other in perſuaſion of this tender care that hee beareth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes his.</p>
            <p>Wherefore the godly were accuſtomed to open vnto others the children of God, the eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all benefites and mercie whiche they had receiued of the Lorde, that they might not onely ioyne with them for the praiſe of his mercie, but alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue increaſe of faith in the viſible experience of his goodneſſe. It is wel knowen that the people of God vnder the law had a ſolemne rite &amp; ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, in perfourming the vowes of thankeſgiuing and peace offering, when ſoeuer they had receiued any notable and ſingular benefite of the Lorde.
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:7047:185"/>
Whiche was a thing ſo well pleaſing the Lorde, that they preſent this their purpoſe, to prayſe the Lorde, and to tell what he had done for them, as a reaſon to perſuade him to worke their deliuerance when they are diſtreſſed, according as wee reade: <hi>Saue me from the Lyons mouthe, and aunſwere me, in ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing me from the hornes of the Vnicornes:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 22 21.</note> 
               <hi>I will declare thy name vnto my brethren: in the middeſt of the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation wil I prayſe thee,</hi> (ſaying) <hi>Praiſe the Lord ye that feare him, magnifie him all yee ſeede of Iacob. For he hath not despiſed nor abhorred the affliction of the poore, but when he calleth vnto him, he heard. My praiſe ſhall be of thee in the great congregation, my vowes wil I perfourme before them that feare him. The pore ſhall eate and be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied: they that ſeeke after the Lorde ſhall praiſe him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This kinde of perſuaſion haue the ſeruants of God often vſed, and therefore wee doe reade that the godly in their petitions haue vſed often theſe words: Shut not vp (ô Lord) the mouthes of them that prayſe thee, open not the mouthes of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, that they may praiſe the power of their i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols, and magnifie a fleaſhly king. They were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded that the Lord did greatly eſteme his owne glorie and honor: that it was a ſpeciall ſeruice and worſhip that he delighteth in, as it is in deede. For euen the end of our ſaluation is the praiſe of his free mercie and grace, and he hath elected his to the prayſe of the riches of his grace: and the end of our temporall deliuerance is to acknowledge and magnifie that grace whiche we haue tryed to bee true, &amp; had good experience of the ſame. So doth
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:7047:185"/>
the godlie king Ezechias confeſſe, that the Lorde would not haue him ſwalowed vp of the pit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the taſte of his mercie in deliueraunce, becauſe if he had ſo departed, the Lorde ſhould then haue wanted that ſeruice of thankes giuing for his deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance which is ſo acceptable vnto him. For thoſe that are ſo ouerwhelmed in their afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s taſt not of the mercies of deliuerance, which openeth their mouth, &amp; filleth it with the prayſes of the Lord. <hi>It was thy pleaſure to deliuer my ſoule</hi> (ſayth Ezechias) <hi>from the pit of corruption,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eſay. 38.17.</note> 
               <hi>for thou haſte caſt all my ſinnes behinde thy back: for the dead cannot prayſe thee, they that go downe into the pitt cannot hope for thy trueth, but the liuing ſhall confeſſe thee as I doe this day. The fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the children ſhall declare thy trueth: the Lorde was ready to ſaue mee, therefore wee will ſing my ſonge all the dayes of our life, in the houſe of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That he ſayth: <hi>The dead cannot prayſe him,</hi> wee haue to take it as the trueth is, that when thoſe that be his are not deliuered in their diſtreſſes, hee wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth that praiſe here in earth (where his glorie is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten oppreſſed) whiche their deliueraunce would plentifully ſpread abroade.</p>
            <p>And they doe moſte thirſte after the tryall of his goodneſſe heere vppon earth, where there bee ſo many enimies to his glorie, that ſeeing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> plaine proofe thereof, they may be plentiful in his praiſe. Therfore doeth Dauid in like manner require de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerance, that he be not ouerwhelmed in his afflli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and ſo the Lord wante the praiſe of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liueraunce: <hi>Returne O Lorde, deliuer my life, ſaue mee
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:7047:186"/>
for thy mercies ſake. For in death there is no remembrance of thee, in the graue who ſhall praiſe thee?</hi> The Scripture is plentifull in ſuch proofes, where the ſeruants of God haue greatly longed for deliuerance, that they might praiſe his name, and haue vrged it as a reaſon to perſuade the Lord to heare their petitions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe then they would offer vnto him that well pleaſing ſacrifice and ſeruice of thankeſgiuing, a ſacrifice that doeth ſo greatly pleaſe the Lorde, and therefore cannot but be well liked of all thoſe that be his.</p>
            <p>It was declared before, that there was a ſolemne rite and ceremonie among y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iewes, in their thanks giuing after ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e greate benefite receiued, where the godlie mett together not only to giue praiſe, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to be confirmed and ſtrengthened more &amp; more in their faith, &amp; perſuaſion of his fatherly care and regarde that he hath towards thoſe that be his. This is made plaine vnto vs in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pſalme: <hi>He hath brought me out of the horrible pit</hi> (ſayth the Prophet) <hi>and hee hath put in my mouth a new ſong of prayſe vnto our God.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 40.2.</note> 
               <hi>Many ſhall ſee it and feare, and ſhall truſt in the Lorde.</hi> It ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not but be a ſingular worſhip of God, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> aſcribeth this right of gouernement and care of his ſeruants vnto him, that alſo hath in it ſuch force to increaſe faith which is the founteine of all obedience. How greate then is the ſinne of vnthankfulneſſe, when men paſſe ouer the benefites of God, and the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red pledges of his fauour, without any thankfull remembraunce or comfortable aſſuraunce of the good will of GOD?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="355" facs="tcp:7047:186"/>Surely the neglect of this duetie (I meane of thanks giuing to God, when we receiue any ſingular bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite, as ſome notable deliuerance from daungers, or happie out going fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our trouble) denieth the Lord to be the diſpoſer and gouernour of thinges here belowe, &amp; fathereth them vpon fortune or chaunce. How ſoeuer they denie it in wordes, it denieth in deede any eſpeciall care to be in God ouer his: it maketh God to be nothing beſide a bare name, and vaine imagination: it ouerthroweth faith, (whiche perſuadeth vs of the ſpeciall care and good will, that God beareth vs in taking his benefites, not as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon thinges, but as pledges of his peculiar fauour,) in that as common matters, and no witneſſes of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny eſpeciall good will, by vnthankfulneſſe they are paſſed ouer, and lightly let ſlippe. Moreouer, the want of this dutie hindereth the profiting of others, in that they denie this helpe of ſtrengthening their faith, which the Lord hath appointed, and the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntes of God hath practiſed, according as it was of late cited out of the Prophet, that many ſhoulde ſee what the Lord had done, and be drawne to put their truſt in him. Now let vs pray vnto our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Father in the name of his ſonne, that we may ſo pray that we may obteine, &amp; ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyning render from a thankful heart true praiſe, and thankſgiuing vnto his name.</p>
